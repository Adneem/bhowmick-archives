After Rangchwanga and the others were released from jail, the landscape of the Mizo hills began to shift rapidly. Armed clashes between security forces and rebels still erupted in the Jhumpai region near Aizawl, with casualties on both sides, but these skirmishes were pushed to the back pages of the newspapers. Instead, the spotlight turned to the city-based political parties.

Negotiations were underway in Delhi. Mizo leaders were meeting with the Prime Minister, demanding full statehood for the district. Headlines screamed that factions of the Mizo National Front (MNF) were coming to an "understanding" with the government.

Meanwhile, the geopolitical tectonic plates were shifting. India signed a treaty with the Soviet Union. Then, in 1971, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intervened in East Pakistan. Citing "humanitarian impulses"—a phrase that rang hollow to Mizo ears—she sent Indian troops to crush Yahya Khan’s army and help establish the Mujib government. Her victory was absolute. She was hailed as a goddess incarnate.

Riding this wave of invincibility, Mrs. Gandhi made a historic announcement on January 21, 1972. Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur would become full-fledged states. For the Mizo hills and Arunachal, she announced Union Territory status.

Elections were set for April 18. A total of 160 candidates vied for thirty assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat. Among them were fifteen former MNF workers who had surrendered to the government.

When the results came in, the verdict was clear. The surrendered rebels failed to win a single seat. The Mizo Union swept the board with twenty-one seats; the Congress took six. A government was formed under C. Chhunga of the Mizo Union. Mizoram was now a Union Territory.

In a secret base deep in the hills, General Thu-Aya and Yangaya sat in contemplation. The shift to open politics and the creation of the Union Territory forced them to re-evaluate their struggle.

"In a revolution," Thu-Aya mused, "obstacles sometimes outweigh favorable conditions. But obstacles can be overcome."

They had to analyze the situation cold-bloodedly. Had the ruling class granted Union Territory status out of benevolence? Or was it a clever dam built to stop the flood of the Mizo national struggle?

"They act not for us, but for their own security," Yangaya said. "Their policy towards the eastern hills has always been driven by fear."

He recalled the letter Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel wrote to Nehru back in 1950, warning of the vulnerabilities in the northeast:

    "Our northern and northeastern flanks... lack close and intimate ties with us. Their inhabitants do not demonstrate established loyalty or devotion to India... I am confident that China, and their inspiration, Soviet Russia, will exploit these vulnerabilities."

The Indian government had failed to integrate the hill tribes emotionally or politically. Now, faced with armed rebellion, they were offering crumbs of power to the "moderate" factions to isolate the hardliners.

"The surrendered MNF workers are singing praises of 'development' and 'central rule,'" Thu-Aya said with a cynical smile. "They might fool the people temporarily, but they cannot save the situation. The desire for true independence cannot be bought with a legislative assembly seat."

He looked at Yangaya. "Who is celebrating this Union Territory status? The old chiefs. The well-off. The classes that lost power after independence. They see a chance to regain their leadership. But the poor? The exploited? They are not celebrating. And our fighters from those classes have not surrendered."

"It proves one thing," Yangaya replied. "In the final analysis, the national struggle is a problem of class struggle."

"Yes," Thu-Aya agreed. "And we cannot fight in isolation. We must look at the international board."

The hypocrisy of the Indian government was glaring. In 1966, when Mizos rose up for freedom, India called it sedition and crushed it with air strikes. In 1971, when East Bengalis rose up for freedom, India called it a "humanitarian crisis" and sent an army to help them.

"Indira Gandhi's heart bled for the Bengalis suffering under Yahya Khan," Yangaya said bitterly. "But when her own army commits atrocities in the Mizo hills? Silence. Because we want to separate from India. Humanity, it seems, has borders."

But the resistance was spreading. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in the Chin and Arakan hills of Burma, the fire was burning. The Ne Win government in Burma was teetering under attacks from the Communist Party of Burma, the Eastern Naga Revolutionary Council (ENRC), and the Karen and Kachin rebels.

There were rumors of a grand alliance. U Nu's National United Liberation Front had proposed a deal to Laldenga: help overthrow Ne Win, and the Mizo-inhabited areas of Arakan, Chin state, and Chittagong would be united under Mizo control in a new Federal Union of Burma.

"A Greater Mizoram," Thu-Aya whispered. "United across three borders."

It was a bold vision. And it was backed by a powerful patron.

Laldenga had traveled to China. He had trekked through the 8,000-foot passes of the Chin hills to Yunnan, taking his family and his aide, Zoramthanga.

Why China? The Indian press screamed about "instigation." They claimed China was using the tribes as pawns.

"Perhaps they are," Thu-Aya admitted. "But China's interests align with ours. They want to weaken the imperialist grip in Asia. We want to break the Indian grip on our land. It is a marriage of convenience."

China offered training, weapons, and ideological clarity. But more importantly, they taught self-reliance. Foreign aid is useful, the Chinese advisors said, but you must rely on your own people.

Back in Aizawl, Rangchwanga tried to make contact. But the security net was tight. The government surveillance was suffocating. He could not find Thu-Aya or Rema.

The movement had fractured physically, but hardened ideologically. The blow from the enemy had not destroyed them; it had tempered them like steel.

Rangchwanga, Thu-Aya, Yangaya, Rema, Rosangi—they were separated by distance and circumstance, but united by a singular understanding. The struggle for Mizo identity was not just a tribal skirmish. It was part of a global class struggle against imperialism and exploitation.

They would not be bought by a Union Territory status. They would not settle for being a "protected" tribe in a vast empire.

The firm directive had come to their hearts. The path was dangerous, the odds were long, but they would move forward. Until the last drop of blood.
