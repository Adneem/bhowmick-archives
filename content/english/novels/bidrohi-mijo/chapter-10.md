When Rangchwanga and his companions were taken out of the Silchar jail and sent on a long journey by train, they did not realize where and for what purpose they were being taken. The minds of Rangchwanga and the others were heavy with an unknown apprehension. The thought of what would happen was constantly tormenting their minds. The authorities divided Rangchwanga and the other Mizo rebels among different jails in Assam and kept them separately. Apart from the various jails in Assam, many were also sent outside Assam. The rebels spent most of their time in different jails worrying about their unknown future. Even after a long time had passed since they were arrested under section 121 of the Indian Penal Code on charges of sedition, the honorable court did not start the trial to establish truth and justice. They were kept confined as undertrial prisoners for a long time in various four-walled enclosures located in distant regions, separated from their homeland. Apart from section 121 of the Indian Penal Code, many were also arrested under various other sections. But when the charge sheet could not be filed, the authorities announced the release of many by dropping the previous charges. Then, naturally, all those prisoners thought that after so many days, they would be released and would be able to return to their homeland. Then a new life force would flow in their minds. Many would float in the tide of joy, but this was not the end. The authorities' machinations did not allow that tide of joy to last long. They would release them from the previous charges, take them out of the jail, and then put them back in jail by applying other sections. To express the glory of the judicial system that is there to establish justice and truth, the authorities would release the Mizo prisoners from the jail gate in this way and then arrest them again under another section and put them in jail. By doing all this, perhaps the authorities wanted to prove to the outsiders that, "Look, we have not just kept the Mizo prisoners." But the outsiders do not fully realize the suffering that the undertrial Mizo prisoners have to endure while such administrative and judicial systems are being implemented. Again, the release of them by the authorities from the previous section...

Although the administrative system could not expedite the release of the Rangchwangas for a long time, the arrest of new Mizo rebels to maintain peace and security did not stop. New Mizo rebels were being arrested by the security forces and brought to jail every day. Most of them were undertrial prisoners.

One morning, Rangchwanga saw four Mizo boys in convict's clothes drawing water from the jail's well. Rangchwanga was a little surprised to see them in convict's clothes. He himself went to them and, addressing them, said, "Hey, it seems your trial in court is over."

— Yes, the court has judged us. All four of us have been sentenced to six months of rigorous imprisonment. one of the boys replied to Rangchwanga's words.

— Only six months?

— Yes, six months.

— Well, that's great then. You have a solution. After six months, you can go back to your respective places.

Hearing such a conversation from Rangchwanga, the boys looked at each other a little. The look was a bit meaningful. It was as if everyone could not hold back their laughter after hearing the words. A faint smile was on everyone's lips. Rangchwanga was embarrassed to see their meaningful look and the faint smile on their faces. He thought to himself, "Are the boys thinking I am a fool?" Anyway, composing himself, he said to them,

— Why are you laughing at my words?

Then one of the boys came forward and, getting close to Rangchwanga, said,

— We can't help but laugh at your words. Because the matter is not as simple as you have taken it. The matter is of a different kind.

— What kind of matter?

— The matter is that the six months we are serving in jail now is not the end.
Saying this, the boy remained silent for a while. Then he started to narrate the incident in detail. He said,

— You know, the four of us were arrested from our homes two years ago. They brought us and kept us in jail as undertrial prisoners. We were thinking that since they have arrested us and kept us in jail as undertrial prisoners, they will surely do something by trying us in court. But as the days passed, it became clear that they would keep us in jail like this for as long as they could. There was no sign of the trial starting in court. So the four of us secretly decided, why should we remain in jail like this? Let's escape from jail instead. As soon as we thought of it, we did it. At night, we broke a part of the ward, jumped over the jail wall, and escaped. But the authorities' henchmen found out about our escape in a moment. In a short time, they spread the cry of "catch, catch" all around. They spread the word everywhere that four Mizos have escaped from jail, catch them by any means. We could not go far. They had set up guards on every road leading out of the city. In the end, we were caught by them in a very helpless state. The way they beat us after we were caught is beyond description. Then they charged us with the crime of escaping from jail and sent us to the honorable court for trial. That honorable court, finding us guilty of the crime of escaping from jail, sentenced us to six months of rigorous imprisonment, and the authorities also sent us here for their security. They could not even file a charge sheet for the charge for which we were first arrested. It is doubtful whether they will ever be able to.

The boy was saying all this in one breath. Then, with a smile on his face, he said to Rangchwanga,

— Look, in our situation, if you say that we can go to our respective places after six months, can we not laugh?

The boy's question made Rangchwanga feel a bit foolish. He could not decide what to say in reply to it at once. So he waited for a while and composed himself. He said,

— Anyway, brother, now I see that your matter is very interesting. I also can't help but laugh now after hearing your matter. You can be proud of your position inside the jail. You are both an undertrial prisoner and a convict at the same time. So your position is much better than ours.

— Yes, our position is good. The authorities have kept us here in a dual role. You can also come to our state if you want.

— No, brother, let it be. I don't need a dual role. I don't lack the courage to fight on the field. But when I think of the beatings inside the jail, my body shivers.

Rangchwanga said these words and laughed himself. While laughing, he thought that he was talking to them, but he did not know their names or anything. He changed the topic and said,

– Well, I am talking to you, but what are your names?
As soon as the question came out of Rangchwanga's mouth, the boy almost snatched it. He said,

— Yes, yes, you have been talking for so long, but you don't know our names, what kind of talk is that? Then I am telling you, you listen. I am Manliana. He is Belendena, he is Lalrenhun, and he is Lindoana.

Pointing to everyone, Manliana introduced them one by one. Then he continued to speak. He said,

— You know, I and Belendena used to study in an engineering college. A few days after coming home on vacation from there, one day the sepoy babus took us from our house. Lalrenhun and Lindoana were also sent from Aizawl with us. Of course, their homes are far from ours. Both Lalrenhun and Lindoana used to study in college.

Rangchwanga learned their names from Manliana. He thought, "Manliana also mentioned his studies while telling his name, so let's tease him a little." He said,

— Look, how they have ruined your prospective life.

— Ruined our prospective life?

— What else? You were studying engineering, you would surely have become a big shot after passing. Instead of that, you are now drawing water in a convict's dress in jail.

— Are you joking with us?

— Why?

— Then why are you talking like this? If we had any prospect in our present situation as a whole, then why are our fellow beings as a nation fighting an armed struggle on the field today? Today, with the earnest desire to be completely independent, are the lives of those who are spending their lives in jail, being arrested by the ruling class as a result of the armed campaign of the Mizos, being ruined? No, no, don't say that. They cannot ruin our lives, but on the contrary, in the true sense, we are all spending our lives in jail today for the overall improvement of the Mizos. You know, I think we should be proud. Today we are serving our sentences for a truly independent Mizoram. Although we are not fighting on the field with arms, our sorrow and hardship will be helpful for the happiness and prosperity of the coming days.

Rangchwanga was just joking with Manliana. He did not realize that he would take it so seriously. Manliana's words touched his heart. He did not prolong the conversation in reply and just said,

— I have nothing to say against what you are saying. But I am just saying that what you have said is right.

Time was passing in the midst of such discussions between Rangchwanga and the Manlianas. Now it is better to go to one's own ward. Thinking this, Rangchwanga said to them,

— Well, brother, I have talked to you for a long time. Now I will go to my own ward. You do your work. It is difficult to say what will happen if the jail babus' evil eye falls on you. Saying this, Rangchwanga left them by the well and walked towards his own ward.

As soon as the sun set, after the file was finished, the warders put all the prisoners in their respective cells and wards and closed the doors. Rangchwanga went to his designated place and sat down. Coming here this time, Rangchwanga noticed that every day, after the ward doors were closed and darkness fell, the Mizo prisoners would start praying together. One of the old pastors who had been arrested from various punjees would lead the prayer meeting every day.

Rangchwanga does not like the songs of the prayer meeting. So when the meeting is going on, he thinks to himself. He cannot directly oppose the prayer meeting either. Because it will not be possible to free the Mizos at once from the way the glory of "Jesus is the true Hari" has been spread in every nook and corner of the Mizo hills for a long time and has brought the Mizos under the influence of Christianity. More than a hundred years ago, when the Mizo attacks were continuously going on in Cachar, the border region of the Mizo district, the bureaucrats of the British imperialism became restless. After a lot of effort in various ways, the military force entered the Mizo hills and a Political Officer was appointed to establish an administrative system there. But the formidable Mizo Lals, with their followers, continued to fight with the British military forces. Many military officers were killed in surprise attacks. The administrative system of British imperialism then understood that it would not be possible to bring the formidable and warlike inhabitants of the Mizo hills under control just by using force. The more force they used to suppress them, the more angry they would become and the more militant they would be to face it. Thinking all this, the imperialist bureaucrats then decided that to bring them under control, the "Jesus is the true Hari" group was urgently needed. That is, the Christian missionaries had to be brought into the Mizo hills to sing the great glory of Jesus and to blunt their warlike and formidable attitude and attract them to religion. British imperialism declared the Mizo district an excluded area and prohibited anyone other than Christian missionaries from entering there without permission. With the loyalty of the administrative bureaucrats, the "Jesus is the true Hari" group, that is, the Christian missionaries, entered the Mizo district in groups. They got busy with the indomitable enthusiasm and zeal to convert the Mizos to Christianity and bring them on the right path. Wherever British imperialism has established its rule, the "Jesus is the true Hari" group has appeared before the inhabitants there like an angel. They have converted the people to Christianity. There is no place where British imperialism has entered but its accomplice, the Christian missionary, is not there. It will be difficult to find such a place. And in the Mizo district, the Christian missionaries...

The missionaries, in large numbers, united and established schools there, introducing education. In a very short time, the inhabitants educated themselves. The literacy rate of the inhabitants of the eastern region surpassed that of the plains. Not only the inhabitants of the eastern region, but no other region of India, except for a part of Kerala, could surpass their literacy rate. Before the rebellion started in the Mizo hills, the literacy rate there was 44 percent.

Although the introduction of education and other changes took place due to the efforts of the missionaries, the British imperialist rule naturally created a "privileged class" in the Mizo district as well. They were selected and appointed to government jobs. Even after the British left, there are many Mizo I.A.S. officers. They are working as efficient officers of the government. Comparatively speaking, there are more Mizo I.A.S. officers than the inhabitants of the plains.
In addition to introducing education and appointing the educated people of the privileged class to various government jobs, the British government, keeping in mind the warlike attitude that was latent in the character of the Mizos on a large scale, gradually inducted a large part of the Mizos into the army. Gradually, the warlike Mizos became fully-fledged soldiers and served the British imperialism.

The Christian missionaries brainwashed the Mizos in such a way that, later on, the Mizos could not tolerate anything other than Christianity. Except for a very small number of Riang, Chakma, and Pawai tribes, everyone has completely accepted Christianity. The situation was such that if any person of any other religion went there to preach their religion, they would be attacked by the Mizos. A little before 1966, the Ramakrishna Mission once made an effort in the Mizo hills to preach and propagate the philosophy of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa there. But the Christian Mizo Christians could not tolerate it. They did not give the opportunity to the proponents of the Ramakrishna Mission to preach and propagate the philosophy of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa in the Mizo hills.
Moreover, the Mizos now stand by the memorials of the missionaries who were attacked and killed while trying to bring the Mizos under control, risking their own lives, and pray on Christmas for the forgiveness of their ancestors. There are memorials of the missionaries who were attacked and killed in various regions of the Mizo hills or in its vicinity. On Christmas, the Mizos gather there and pray in chorus. They say, "O benevolent one, our ancestors did not know how great and holy you were. You came to lead us from darkness to light. Our ancestors killed you because they were ignorant. We ask for your forgiveness for their crime. Surely you will forgive."

Rangchwanga was lying on his bed, thinking all this. In the meantime, the prayer of the undertrial Mizo prisoners in the jail was over. The jail bell also rang a few times in keeping with the time. Now, as the depth of the night is gradually increasing, the jail is also becoming silent. Only occasionally, the shouts of the convict on guard inside the various wards can be heard. Rangchwanga had not fallen asleep yet. He is thinking that the influence of Christianity that has been falling on the general population of the Mizo district for generations and the সংস্কার (sanskara - cultural conditioning) that has been formed, it will not be possible to remove the Mizos from it at once. Those who are imprisoned in jail today will continue to pray to Lord Jesus in this way. If one tries to obstruct it, the result will be the opposite. However, the case of those who are fighting on the field with arms today is different. Although the সংস্কার (sanskara) of Christianity is in their marrow, how much time do they get today in the leisure of the fight to remember Jesus? The thought of the fight is so ingrained in their minds that the thought of Jesus can no longer arise. Thinking in this way, Rangchwanga did not realize when he had fallen asleep.
