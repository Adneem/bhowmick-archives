Rosangi and Lalchungi are walking along a narrow path, breaking through the ups and downs, from the jhum field to their punjee. Both are walking side by side. Both have two baskets on their backs. The baskets are not like the baskets made in the plains. They are quite large in size and strong and sturdy. A belt made of cane or cloth is attached to the top. The entire basket is placed on the back and the belt is fastened to the forehead. One does not need both hands to move around with these kinds of baskets. Almost all the hill dwellers of the hilly regions of Assam use this type of basket. One can easily cross the ups and downs with the baskets loaded, keeping both hands free. Rosangi and Lalchungi are walking with the entire basket on their backs, the belt fastened to their foreheads, and their hands free.

The narrow path, after breaking through the ups and downs, meets the main road a short distance away. On the high hillock next to the main road is the camp of the military officers. They have to walk along the narrow path that goes down past the camp. Rosangi and Lalchungi, while walking, came to the path that goes down past the camp and stood there. After walking continuously for a long time, breaking through the ups and downs, their bodies were feeling a little tired. Rosangi thought it would be good to drink some water and rest here for a while. A spring flows down from the high hillock and merges with the main road here. Water flows with a murmuring sound throughout the year. However, during the monsoon, the flow is a bit stronger. Rosangi said - "Let's drink some water and rest here for a while."

Saying this, she put down the basket on the road and slowly went down to the stream, washed her hands and feet, and started drinking water from her cupped hands. Lalchungi also put down her basket on the road and started to go down. She then saw a man coming out of the military camp on the hillock. As Lalchungi was going down, she said to Rosangi, — A sepoy from above is watching us.

— Don't look at him, drink water quickly, we'll get out of here. Rosangi said while drinking water. Lalchungi also went down without looking up, washed her hands and feet, and started drinking water from her cupped hands. In this deserted environment, it was as if there was no thought in their minds that there could be any third person other than the two of them. Of course, Rosangi slowly said to Lalchungi — It is difficult to say what the mood of these rascals is at any given time. They become restless when they see us.

— Shall I take a sidelong glance to see what that bastard is doing?

— No, no need to look. Let's go now. Saying this, Rosangi came up from the stream to the road. Lalchungi also came with Rosangi.

The man who had come out of the camp was watching Rosangi and Lalchungi from the top of the hillock. The environment created by the movement of the limbs of the two Mizo girls in various postures, standing by the side of the stream flowing with a monotonous murmuring sound, seemed very pleasant to the sepoy babu. He was enjoying the pleasure standing on the top of the hillock. But he could not bear to see Rosangi and Lalchungi getting up and getting ready to leave. He thought, let's detain them for some time and have some fun. So he shouted loudly at them,

— Hey, what are you doing over there?

— Oh no, what I thought has happened. The son of a bitch has seen us. He will detain us for some time now, if not more. Rosangi said to Lalchungi after hearing the man's shout. Then she turned and, looking at the man on the hillock, said — Babu Sahab, we came here to drink water. Saying this, Rosangi gestured to Lalchungi and said — Let's go. As soon as they started to leave, the sepoy shouted even louder — Hey, listen, come here.

— He won't let us go so easily. Lalchungi said.

— Hmm, it seems so. And you can't just leave without listening to him.

Both of them started walking towards the hillock to obey the sepoy sahib's order. As they were walking, Rosangi whispered — When you talk to him, talk with a bit of a flirtatious attitude, you'll see he'll melt. You have to show some attitude and take the opportunity to slip away from him.

Lalchungi could not help but laugh at Rosangi's words. She did not say anything, though. However, with a hint of a smile on her face, she slowly walked on.

As they went near the man, he said to them in a deep, serious voice,

— Why are you making the water over there dirty?

— No, Babu Sahab, not to make the water dirty, we went there to drink water. Rosangi said in a soft tone.

— Hmm, where is your house?

— It will be a little far from here. We come and go here every day, Babu Sahab. There is a lot of work in the jhum field at this time.

Lalchungi had not forgotten the words about showing a flirtatious attitude. In between listening to the conversation between the two, she was looking at the sepoy. And she was showing that she liked the sepoy babu, that she was fond of him. Noticing Lalchungi's attitude, the sepoy asked her,

— Where is your house?

— Both of our houses are in the same punjee, Babu Sahab.

— Do you also come and go every day?

— Yes.

— Well, if you need to drink water, come to our camp. Don't go to the stream over there. Understood? the sepoy said, addressing both Lalchungi and Rosangi.

— Okay, Babu Sahab. both Rosangi and Lalchungi said and expressed their gratitude. Before leaving, Rosangi turned back and, with a smile on her face, said,

— Babu Sahab, come to our house one day. We will be very happy.

— Okay, okay, I will definitely go to your punjee.

Rosangi and Lalchungi walked swiftly along the narrow path towards the punjee. As they were walking, Rosangi said — Well, the bastard let us go easily.

— He has thought that he has got a line for good, so if he goes too far today, everything will be ruined. That's why he let us go quickly. What do you say? Saying this, Rosangi asked for Lalchungi's opinion.

— Why wouldn't he think so? The way you were looking at him again and again, I thought you had really fallen in love with him.
Then I have been able to convey the flirtatious attitude correctly.

— Yes, you have conveyed more than necessary. But I couldn't do it like you. If you weren't there, I would have run away as soon as I heard the sound. And then he would have chased us into the jungle and caught us. You have a good brain, my dear! But if the Remas find out that you are going to flirt with the sepoys, they will beat you up.

— You just watch, I will push him to a place by showing him affection every day. I will tell the Remas and trap these bastards in such a way that they will realize where their pleasure comes from.

— Whatever you do, my dear, just don't bring trouble.

— What do you mean, bring trouble? We are always in trouble. As soon as we leave the punjee, a sense of panic always arises in our minds. What these rascals will do at any time. Moreover, they also attack by raiding the punjee. In such a situation, what trouble will we bring? Now we have to take many risks to get out of trouble.

Rosangi and Lalchungi, talking to each other, reached their punjee. First, after entering the punjee, they had to turn left and go to Lalchungi's house along a small road. Standing at the turn, she said to Rosangi - "Mangthale." Rosangi also replied, "Mangthale." Then the two of them went their separate ways. Rosangi slowly, bending a little, walked step by step up the slope towards her house. She would reach home in a very short time. The tired body, carrying the fatigue of the whole day, could be given a rest for a while with a sense of security.

That night, Rema was very late in returning home. After darkness fell with the evening, Rosangi was spending every moment with anxiety. Because usually, when Rema says she will return, there is no exception. As he was late in returning even after saying that he would return in the evening, Rosangi could not wait any longer. From the small church in front of the pastor's house in the distance, the sound of the clock striking eight, "ding dong," was heard. Then nine. No, Rema still had not returned. In the absence of her loved one, a sense of foreboding was rising in her mind. Anyway, Rema finally returned. Rosangi was listening. As soon as she heard the sound of footsteps, she became alert. As soon as Rema knocked on the door, Rosangi opened it. Seeing Rema after opening the door, she heaved a sigh of relief. It was as if her suffocated life had returned.

— I was getting suffocated with worry seeing you so late. Rosangi said to Rema.

— I went for some work, that's why I am so late. Rema said, taking off her shoes and stretching her body on the bed on the machan. After being silent for a while, she said again,

— We can't stay in this punjee for much longer, Rosangi.

— Why?

— The government will break all the punjees.

— Break them?

— Yes, they are already putting anyone they suspect in jail. Now, those who are left will be kept under military guard in houses built by the side of the main road. Ours will probably be broken soon.

— So we will have to go and live on the main road under military guard?

— If we stay here, they will force us to do that. So we have to get out of here in the meantime.

— We will have to tolerate whatever they do. We will not resist? Rosangi asked after hearing Rema's words.

— Yes, we will get out of here to give them a befitting reply. When the enemy attacks us with great force, we have to take flight as a strategy. The purpose of today's flight is to consolidate the strength to resist in the coming days.

Hearing Rema's words, Rosangi was thinking to herself. After living in this punjee for a long time, the intimate relationship that had developed with the sky and air here, the climate here, every tree and plant of the deep jungle, has to be severed and we have to go deeper from here. But why? Is it because the opponent is strong that they will carry out intense oppression on us today? Will they forcibly evict us from the punjee of our intimate daily life and treat us like animals in their pen? Will they be able to suppress us by carrying out intense oppression? Surely not. No matter how much they oppress us, we will face it. We will move forward with the indomitable desire to strike the enemy in any way we can. While thinking all this, the face of that officer sepoy of the camp floated in Rosangi's mind. Immediately, a feeling of revenge appeared in her mind. She thought, they have to be taught a befitting lesson. The fake bond of love that I have built today, I have to use that to punish them.

Lying on the bed, Rema was thinking about leaving this punjee. Rosangi called her and said — We went to the sepoy officers' camp on the main road today.

— Why?

— They had called us. I and Lalchungi were drinking water in the stream next to their camp on our way back from the jhum field. Then a sepoy called us.

— What did he do there?

— What else would he do? The real goal was to have fun with us.

— Then when did he let you go?

— He let us go quickly. I and Lalchungi both showed the bastard a lot of affection. And we hinted that it would not be convenient in the camp. If he comes to our punjee, his desire will not remain unfulfilled.

— So will he come?

— It seems he will. If the bait is cast a little better, he will come slithering. You just have to lie in wait secretly with your colleagues, so that if they come, they can't go back.

— Then make arrangements to bring them within two or three days.

Then Rosangi and Lalchungi went to the officers' camp for two more days on their way back from the jhum field and asked for water themselves. Along with talking to the man from the first day, they attracted two or three more people, and Rosangi and Lalchungi showed such an attitude that even if you jawans don't want us, we can't control our growing bodies ourselves.

You have to come to our place. It is urgent for you to satisfy the demands of our youthful passion.

The sepoys were finally attracted by Rosangi and Lalchungi's bait. The afternoon was turning into evening. Led by Rosangi and Lalchungi, they were walking along the narrow, winding path to their punjee. The environment in which the four of them were walking, surrounding the two Mizo girls, was very charming. At every moment, a sweet wave of romance was flowing through every weapon of the jawans. The calm environment, the physical structure of the hill girls, and the intense desire to satisfy their own lust were making them restless and they were thinking how soon they would reach their punjee.

Before going to bring them from the camp, Rosangi had made arrangements to entertain the guests. The arrangement was not very grand. Some pork and some liquor made in their punjee. The arrangement of the liquor was such that they could be kept drunk until darkness fell in the evening.

As soon as Rosangi entered the punjee, she went a little ahead and asked them to follow her. Lalchungi followed her, and behind Lalchungi, the other four sepoys followed in a sort of queue. Rosangi came in front of her house, opened the door, and welcomed them inside. But the sepoys first stood outside and looked at the beautiful scenery all around. Then one by one, they all entered Rosangi's house and sat on the machan.

— Babu Sahab, you have come a long way on foot. Please rest for a while. Saying this, Rosangi offered them the bottle of liquor and the meat.

— Hey, what is the need for food and drink?

— Please, you have come to my house, so please have some food, Sahab.

— Okay, we will eat. You eat first. Lalchungi then took some meat and put it in her mouth and took a few sips of liquor from the bottle.

After Rosangi and Lalchungi ate, they also started eating a little bit of meat and liquor. While eating, they were thinking, "We will not be satisfied with just your hospitality of liquor and meat. We want you too. Of course, if we don't get a little tipsy from the liquor and meat, it won't be fun with you. So we will get a little drunk and then have fun with you."

Rosangi was also offering the liquor pot to each of them one by one, taking advantage of the opportunity. Showing a bit of a tipsy attitude, she would fall on one of them once and then on another. Lalchungi was also working as Rosangi's accomplice in the same way. In this way, time was passing, and with the passing of time, the sepoy babus were also getting engrossed in the intoxication. When they were completely intoxicated, Rosangi suddenly went out of the house. By then, the darkness of the evening had surrounded everything. Four male animals, intoxicated with passion, found Lalchungi in the house and were about to devour her with rage. Just then, a few shadow figures seemed to stand on the veranda of the dark house. No, not shadow figures. Rema's colleagues had come. First, they brought Lalchungi out of the house. Then, standing face to face, they all brutally finished off the four male animal enemies who were intoxicated with colorful passion.

After this incident, the twelve inhabitants of the four houses of this punjee and Rema's other colleagues all left the punjee and, crossing the difficult mountain path, advanced into the darkness of the night. They were already breaking all the nearby punjees and guarding the main road to stop the Mizos. After this incident, the attack that would come from the enemy side would be tantamount to pushing themselves into the face of destruction if they tried to face it from here.
