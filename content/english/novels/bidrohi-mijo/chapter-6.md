Rangchwanga and his colleagues were confined in a guarded cell of the military cantonment in Aizawl. The arrest of Rangchwanga and his colleagues was different from that of all the others who had been arrested. The jawans of the security forces had surrounded them and brought them from the very place of operation. They had ongoing contact with other fighting Mizo rebels. Therefore, information had to be extracted from them somehow.

When Rangchwanga and his colleagues were captured and the jawans were taking them away as prisoners, they had already thought that this incident of capture would take them a long way. The real shock of the capture was waiting ahead. They would try to extract information from them in various ways, by hook or by crook. They would torture them in various ways. That torture would be very terrible. They would make them restless by torturing them both mentally and physically. Of course, what is there to fear for those who have been initiated into the mantra of death? They have to move forward with the mantra of "fear not". They have to face all situations with "fear not".

Three employees of the military department were sitting in a small room. The armed sepoys brought Rangchwanga from his cell under guard and presented him before the military employees. One by one, everyone started questioning him. As soon as one person's question ended, another person started asking a question. The intention of all three was to extract secret information from Rangchwanga somehow. Where are the secret hideouts of the Mizo rebels, from where do they collect weapons and where are the real leaders of the rebels, etc., all this information had to be extracted from him.

But no effort of the military officers could make Rangchwanga restless. Because he knows that these people have been appointed with the intention of foiling and suppressing the path he has taken to make his motherland completely independent. His path and their path are different. The purpose of each of their questions is to know about the rebels and, based on that, to strengthen their policy of oppression and serve their masters properly. Therefore, where Rangchwanga has entered into a face-to-face fight with the enemy with the indomitable desire to make the country independent by making death his servant, he cannot tell any secret to the enemy as long as the last drop of blood remains in his body.

In the first stage, the military officers could not extract any information from Rangchwanga by asking various kinds of questions. Then they started the second stage of interrogation. From intermittently hitting all the joints of the body with a roller with great force to piercing the tips of each fingernail with a needle. After torturing him in this way for some time, he was left alone. Then again, when he regained consciousness, they carried out the same torture as before. When his chest was bursting with thirst, they would place a glass of water in front of him. As soon as he went to drink it, they would take it away again. But despite doing all this, they could not extract any information from Rangchwanga that could be of any use to them. In the end, the military officers themselves lost their mental patience.

When all efforts to extract information from Rangchwanga failed, the military officers were forced to send him to the Silchar jail from Aizawl under strict guard with the others. After entering the Silchar jail, seeing most of the prisoners there, Rangchwanga at first thought that they had brought a whole town from the Mizo district. After coming to the jail, Rangchwanga noticed that every two or three days, new Mizo rebels were being arrested and brought to the jail. According to the rules of the jail manual of the government, in a ward where only fifteen prisoners are supposed to be confined, at least one hundred and fifty prisoners are being put in. As soon as the jail warders come and close everything in the evening, the inside of the ward takes on an unimaginable form. The arrangement here is exactly like the way various inanimate objects are stuffed into a small box or bag by turning them upside down. It is difficult to imagine how one hundred and fifty people spend the night in this fifteen-person room from the time the sun sets on the previous day until the sun rises on the next day.

Usually, people work hard during the day and refresh their tired bodies by sleeping at night, but here the opposite is the case. After spending the whole night in an uncomfortable situation, they can get some fresh air in the morning. As soon as it is dawn, just as the owner opens the cage of the chicks, the warders open the doors of the wards and when all the prisoners are made to sit in a file, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief. They get a little movement after being freed from the uncomfortable environment of the whole night. One day, after returning from the file, Rangchwanga sat in the ward and noticed a boy sitting next to him. He has also been imprisoned as a Mizo rebel. The independent government of India has arrested that boy under section 121 of the Penal Code. The charge is that he has declared war to overthrow the democratically established government by violent means. Rangchwanga asked the boy,

— What is your name?

— Zairema

— In which part of the Mizo hills is your home?

— In a punjee next to Nahthial.

— Did they arrest you from there?

— Yes, one morning the sepoys came and surrounded our entire punjee and arrested us. They didn't beat me much, but they beat the others very much.

— Yes, if they can catch us, their power increases a lot, then they will torture a lot. But in the jungle, if they hear a blank shot, they often get so scared that they wet their pants.

Zairema was very amused to hear the sarcastic comment about the sepoy forces from Rangchwanga. He could not hold back his laughter. He giggled, and before the smile on his face faded, Rangchwanga asked again, "Did you study?"

— Yes

— In which class?

— In class seven.

— Who is in your house?

— My mother and two younger brothers.

As soon as the question of home came up, Zairema became a little absent-minded, the face of his mother floated before his eyes. The helpless look of his two younger brothers. When they entered the punjee and ransacked everything and went to arrest him from his house, naturally, his mother's affection for her son made her anxious. She protected Zairema and said, "No, you can't take my son away. He is my support, he has done no wrong." But the sepoys did not pay any heed to his mother's words. A sepoy pushed his mother away with a jerk and dragged Zairema away. The helpless old woman cried out loudly. The two younger brothers, not understanding anything, started screaming along with their mother in fear, seeing such treatment of their mother and brother. Zairema was completely helpless in the hands of the sepoys. There was nothing he could do. Only seeing the helpless condition of his mother and younger brothers, tears were rolling down his eyes.

Thinking all this, Zairema said to Rangchwanga — "You know, whenever I think of home, I feel like crying, I think of my mother, I think of my younger brothers. At first, I couldn't control myself at all. I see that everyone here has the same sorrow as me. When the topic of home comes up, some feel sad for their parents, and some for their wives and children. Now, of course, this sorrow does not affect me as much as before."

Rangchwanga was listening to the words attentively. After Zairema finished speaking, he said — "Yes, it is natural to feel sad. But in our current situation, we have to gradually overcome this sorrow. Because the purpose for which we have taken an oath today, they will try to push us into various disasters to foil it. So if we die among ourselves, lamenting that we are suffering there, it will not do. Because no great purpose can be achieved easily. Therefore, we have to endure sorrow, hardship, and pain to achieve our purpose. We have to face them with courage and move forward."

Zairema was happy to hear Rangchwanga's words. Not only that, hearing his words, the desire to be a hero arose in his mind. He started thinking and, while thinking, he suddenly grabbed Rangchwanga's hand and said — "Come on, brother, I will show you a place." At this time, the power of the warders is a little less. Taking this opportunity, he took him to a cell located on the south side of their ward. Going there, Zairema said to Rangchwanga - "Our Pu Laldenga used to stay in this cell."

— Is that so?

— Yes.

— How do you know?

— A warder told me that after arresting Laldenga, he was brought to this cell in the Silchar jail. You know, when he used to stay in this cell, he used to study a lot. He would always be reading one book or another.

— Did the warder say this too?

— Yes.

— Have you ever seen Pu Laldenga?

— No, I haven't seen him, but I have heard a lot about him. He was the leader of the Mizo National Front, wasn't he?

— Yes.

— Well, where is he now?

— Wherever he is, he is ours.

— You know, the warder had said that after staying here for a long time, suddenly news came to send Pu Laldenga to Shillong. Then Pu Laldenga was taken to Shillong. There he had discussions with the ministers. After that, after being released from there, no news of Pu Laldenga was found.

Rangchwanga was talking to Zairema standing next to the boy. In the meantime, the warders' gaze had fallen on them two or three times. Noticing that, Rangchwanga thought that there was no point in provoking the bastards by standing here, those bastards are already angry with us. They can come and give a few blows on any pretext. He said to Zairema, — "There is no point in standing here anymore. Let's go to our ward, otherwise the warders will come and abuse us." Saying this, Rangchwanga took Zairema with him and walked to their ward.

The days were passing in a routine way inside the jail. The frequent blustering and glaring of the warders would spoil Rangchwanga's mood for some time. In the midst of all this, he would talk to the prisoners who came from the Mizo district every day. One day, Rangchwanga met Thanglura, an inhabitant of a punjee near Bankan, next to him. Thanglura was one of the new arrivals in the jail. Thanglura used to teach in a school next to Bankan. He was managing his family, consisting of his old father who was bedridden with cancer, his wife, and a small child, with difficulty. But due to the special situation in the Mizo district, like others, he was also dragged out of his house before dawn one day, thinking he was a volunteer of the Mizo National Frontier. When the sepoys tied him up and took him away, his dying old father could not say anything. He only looked at him with tearful eyes. The child also could not say anything. His mother, with a heart full of tears, stood holding him in her arms. From his mother's lap, he was looking at Thanglura. He could not understand where the people were taking his father, tied up. After being tied up and brought from his house, he was not spared from interrogation or torture. After doing all this, he was sent to this jail.

After experiencing the life of a prisoner in jail for two or three days, Thanglura came to Rangchwanga and said,

— Hey, what do you see?

— What else is there to see? I am feeling everything to the core.

— Well, do they think we are jungle animals because we live in the hills?

— What they think is difficult to say. But the way they are keeping us here is like animals.

— How long will they keep us like this?

— It is difficult for us to say. Since they have caught us and brought us under their control, they will squeeze us according to their will.

— That is true, they can chop off our heads according to their will. But they will not be able to suppress the Mizo rebels. This cannot happen, no nation can be suppressed if that nation is determined to achieve freedom. The enemy has to admit defeat in the end in the face of the indomitable struggle of a freedom-loving nation. Thinking these words, Rangchwanga again said to Thanglura - "No matter how much they torture us inside the jail, you will see that they will not be able to suppress the Mizo rebels."

— Can there be failure among the Mizo rebels?

— Yes, there can be temporary failure. But they will not stop for that. They will struggle, fail, and struggle again until victory, this is how they will move forward. The way they are torturing us today, our future generations will judge it. If we have any mistakes, they will correct them. A new group will come forward, inspired by national consciousness. They will uphold and advance the national characteristics.

Seeing Rangchwanga and Thanglura discussing, a few more Mizo prisoners sat around them. Many of them do not understand politics well. But they all understand that the demand for the independence of Mizoram and the problem that has arisen in making it a reality, everyone is a partner in that problem. They also understand that they are criminals in the eyes of the government. However, so that the real crime is judged, every evening after prayer, they tell Lord Jesus, "O Lord, they have snatched us from our punjee, which is connected to our roots, and put us in jail. They have separated us from our loved ones, our dear ones. They are torturing us. Because we are Mizos, today we are enduring this torture far away from our loved ones. In return for the sorrow and hardship we are suffering, may our children, mothers, fathers, and siblings be well." Rangchwanga does not like this matter of theirs. In the way the struggle is going on in the real field among the oppressed, why bring the invisible Jesus into it? One side wants to suppress and the other side wants to uproot it, that is, it does not want to remain subjugated. What can the invisible Lord Jesus do in this face-to-face fight between two opposing sides? Of course, they have nothing to do inside the jail, so Jesus comes and sits on their heads. This cannot happen if the people are constantly engaged in a struggle with the enemy in the open field. The method of armed struggle itself prepares them in such a way that they do not get the opportunity to bother with the invisible Jesus.

Anyway, Rangchwanga feels good to see that many of those who entrust the well-being of their loved ones to Lord Jesus in the prayer meeting have also come and sat next to Thanglura and Rangchwanga and are listening to their discussion.

While continuing to think and discuss in this way, suddenly the jail's alarm bell rang. The warders were running, blowing their whistles. And on the other hand, the alarm bell was ringing. A tense atmosphere arose inside the jail in a moment. Everyone rushed to the window of the ward and started looking outside.

— Look, look, the assistant jailer is running for his life. And a man is chasing him with a dao.

— Is the man behind trying to catch him?

— Yes, from the way he is running, it seems so.

— Oh my god, will there be a murder inside the jail in the end?

— Is the man behind crazy?

— No, no, not crazy. He is a prisoner of ward number six. That young man is a very cruel bastard. He doesn't care about the warders at all.

After chasing the assistant jailer for two or three minutes, it was seen that more warders came and somehow caught the young man by running from behind. Then they tied him up and put him in a cell and locked the door. The fat jailer babu then heaved a sigh of relief. Of course, he had not been able to overcome the shock of running for his life. He was still panting, surrounded by the warders.

After a while, when the atmosphere of the jail cooled down, the real matter reached everyone. The government jailer sahib used to commit serious fraud every day while giving rations to the prisoners. That is, from thieves, swindlers, and anti-socials to all kinds of prisoners who came to the jail, it was his habit to cheat from their allotted rations. All the bureaucrats appointed to supervise the prison, in collusion with the contractor, use all kinds of corruption to serve their own interests. From the first stage of distributing the tender to the arrival at the godown, at every stage, the ration allotted for the government's thieves, swindlers, anti-socials, and other prisoners keeps decreasing, and from what reaches the godown, the assistant jailer babu has to take his share. Besides that, there is very bad behavior towards everyone. The cruel young man, although he probably did not know everything, could not tolerate the government jailer babu's theft of the thieves' rations. He thought that they steal outside, taking risks, and if they are caught, their bones get dislocated from the beating. And that bastard, being a jailer, is carrying on safely here. That bastard is much more of a scoundrel than a street thief. If you have to steal, then go out and steal like a thief. But no, the babu is stealing the thieves' food inside the four walls. Thinking all this, perhaps the cruel young man had thought that he would teach him a good lesson one day. So today, getting the opportunity, he was chasing the babu.

Although the incident gave pleasure to all the prisoners inside the jail, it was considered very serious by the bureaucrats who supervised the prison. Such great courage inside the jail that he went to attack the assistant jailer with a dao in broad daylight. Such a serious crime must be punished appropriately. The jail super, the jailer, and the other assistant jailers together entered the cruel young man's cell, tied his hands and feet, and beat him mercilessly with a cane, and he was ordered to be locked up in his cell for twenty-four hours.

Who gave you the right to go and beat the thief jailer because he is stealing the allotted ration of the thieves? We are the jailers. We are the jail super. The responsibility has been entrusted to us to supervise you. There, if we can make our arrangements by colluding with the contractor, and secure our future by doing this and that, then why will you, a thief, come to beat us? Rangchwanga thought, this is probably the attitude of the jail bureaucracy.

It is true, let the jail bureaucrats do whatever they want. But why should the jail prisoners do anything against it? In the eyes of the law, they do not have that fundamental right. However, from what Rangchwanga has become aware of about the deeds of the bureaucrats from inside the jail, it has occurred to him that the bureaucrats are much more guilty than the jail prisoners. Even if the bureaucrats are put in the thieves' cells for their deeds and their plump bodies are caned, it is less than the appropriate punishment.

Be that as it may, the more the prison life inside the jail passed, the more Rangchwanga was gaining new experiences. Gradually, the days of his prison life were increasing. Suddenly one afternoon, the jail authorities called Rangchwanga and a few of his fellow prisoners and informed them that they had to be ready in the last part of the night. An order has come from the higher authorities that the twenty of them will not be kept here anymore. Rangchwanga and the others could not know in advance where, why, and how they would be taken. Rangchwanga and the other fellow prisoners, after receiving the order from the authorities, began to think of many things. They could not sleep that night. Everyone spent the night with anxiety.

Before dawn, the sentries came and cordoned off the path through which they would be taken inside the jail. One by one, they were all tied up and made to stand in a line and put in a van. The silence that the sepoy sentries were maintaining made it seem as if they were being taken to a place of execution through a deep conspiracy.

Escort vehicles were placed in front and behind. And in the middle, the prisoners were kept in a prison van, in which were Rangchwanga and his fellow prisoners. In a short while, the vehicle started. The vehicle started moving with a sound. After the van had been running for ten or fifteen minutes, it stopped at a place. Then again, a number of sepoy sentries stood in a cordon, and they were taken through it. One by one, they were pushed into a compartment of a train standing on the railway line. The arrangement there was also made with good attention to security.

Among the prisoners, they had also brought Zairema. He had not gone anywhere outside the Cachar district from the Mizo hills. He had never even seen a train. He has boarded a train today because he was arrested. Although he had a sense of joy and curiosity about the train, an unknown fear was making him very dejected. He slowly came and sat next to Rangchwanga and said - "Brother, where are we being taken?" — Like you, I also know nothing. But it seems they will take us far away. Otherwise, why would they put us on a train?

— You know, I am feeling scared for some reason.

— There is no use in being scared. You will only suffer for nothing. So don't be scared. Gather courage. Zairema said nothing. He sat quietly.

As time passed, the train moved on. The train on the hill line was running, leaving one station after another behind. During the two or three minute stop at the station, people were getting on or off to reach their destination. The moving people on the platform were sometimes peeking into Rangchwanga's compartment. Many were probably looking at them and thinking, "Oh my god, where are they taking these people, tied up like this under military guard? Who are these people? Are they thieves and robbers or something else?" Many were probably looking at their faces and thinking that they were probably Mizo rebels.

As the train moved on, leaving behind the hill stations of North Cachar like Mailongdisa, Harangajao, Jatinga, etc., Rangchwanga was also looking out of the window and thinking of many things. He was thinking that all the inhabitants of the deep forest surrounding all the hill stations are hill tribes. At present, the way we are being oppressed and persecuted, they too must be oppressed and persecuted in the same way. We have entered into an armed struggle, ignoring the obstacles, to be free from the shackles of oppression and persecution, to be truly independent. They too will perhaps one day break free from the shackles of oppression and persecution. If the reactionary forces stand in their way of being free and independent, then they will face it with arms. Then they may have to go in the same way.

Rangchwanga is thinking, and with his thoughts, the train is also moving forward in a serpentine motion with its own "jhik jhik" sound. Occasionally, the train's whistle pierces the silence of the mountains even more. The sound echoes from hill to hill. Hearing the train's whistle, Rangchwanga feels as if it is shouting to the inhabitants of the mountains, "O inhabitants of the mountains, see, I am carrying Rangchwanga and his fellow prisoners, but many of them do not know where they are being taken."
