Rangchwanga and his colleagues were lying in wait in the dense jungle a short distance from the road next to Thingdawl. Seeing the military van moving along the road, Rangchwanga could not control himself. The bullets from his gun came out with a "gudum, gudum" sound, targeting the van. His colleagues also fired at the target. After a few shots were fired, bullets started coming out continuously from the other side with a "tak tak" sound.

— Oh my god, it seems I have poked a hornet's nest.

— Huh, they got cheap bullets, so they are firing continuously without stopping.

It seems they will riddle the entire mountain. In the midst of the "tak tak" sound spreading across the vast mountain, a few "gudum, gudum" sounds came out from the guns of Rangchwanga and his men. Hearing the "gudum, gudum" sound, the enemy side got even more agitated. Then the enemy forces divided into three groups and started firing from three places, surrounding their hideout. After firing like this for a long time, they took a breather. Then the sound coming from the opposite side echoed. It was heard, "March ahead. Surround them from three sides." The soldiers of the enemy forces, with their weapons in hand, advanced step by step in a charging posture towards the jungle-covered hill of Rangchwanga and his men.

— Oh no! The bastards are now coming to surround us. a colleague said. Immediately, Rangchwanga said, — Fire at them.

Breaking the silence all around, the barrel of the gun roared again with a "gudum, gudum" sound. As soon as they heard the sound of the gunshots, the enemy soldiers stopped in their tracks. They could not advance in a charging posture. They quickly lay down on the ground and, losing all sense of direction, started firing continuously from their respective weapons with a "tak tak" sound.

After a long time had passed in this way, Rangchwanga ordered his colleagues to roll backwards. The continuous sound of the enemy's bullets shook the entire mountain region. On the other hand, Rangchwanga and his colleagues slowly retreated into the inaccessible region behind. After Rangchwanga and his colleagues had gone far away, the enemy forces divided into different groups and advanced through the jungle to conduct a combing operation on their abandoned area. The military officer's orders were strict. They must be caught. One unit, after receiving the officer's order, was going crazy and at one point realized that they had entered the deep jungle of the mountain. They had lost their way in the deserted forest, separated from their group. Far from catching the Mizo rebels through a combing operation, it was now difficult to even save themselves and get out of the jungle. In such a helpless situation, a feeling of great despair arose among the jawans. Apprehension and anxiety continued to grow in their minds. It seemed as if the Mizos would attack at any moment. Even greater was the fear of wild animals. Gradually, the terrible darkness of the night began to engulf the place.

The jawans also sat together in the darkness with unknown anxiety. Everyone was terrified. It would not be possible to advance anywhere else in the darkness. They would have to stay here all night. What would happen after that was unknown.
Before dawn, when the darkness of the night had not yet disappeared, the jawans decided that there was no point in sitting like this. Let's get up and start now. If we can find the way to the road somehow. Thinking this, the jawans got up and started. They advanced very cautiously, making their way secretly through the jungle. After going some distance, they saw six or seven people sleeping soundly in a small open space in the jungle.

The jawans thought, now these six or seven people must be caught somehow. If the lost and bewildered jawans can make good use of this opportunity, the glory of their victory will spread. Even if they don't get the Param Vir Chakra, the force will surely not be deprived of some reward. When the unknown fear was reminding them of death, why would they be deprived of the glory of achieving victory when they got such an opportunity? Slowly, all the jawans became very cautious and, forming a circle, suddenly caught the seven people in their sleep. Waking up with a start, the seven Mizo rebels saw that they were completely captured by the enemy.

Rangchwanga and his colleagues, after fighting for a long 4/5 hours, had blocked the path of the enemy forces and retreated through the jungle to this place and sat down with a sense of security. The fatigue of the whole day had exhausted their entire bodies. They could not go any further. At night, sitting here, they were thinking that they would leave this area and go elsewhere at the first touch of the morning light. But such a deep sleep had come over their tired bodies that Rangchwanga and his colleagues did not notice anything. The group that had lost its way and was afraid of death at every moment, in the end, Rangchwanga and his colleagues were captured by them. This was a terrible accident. Slowly, the sun peeked out, spreading a reddish glow in the eastern sky. The dim darkness disappeared from the entire forest area. The jawans, having unexpectedly captured seven Mizo rebels, started walking. They still did not know the right way. Which way would be better to go. Time passed. There was no longer a reddish glow in the eastern sky. The sun's rays were gradually becoming stronger. The jawans were also walking in step with time. Suddenly, the sound of a vehicle came from a distance. Keeping the sound in mind, the jawans advanced here and there. Finally, from the top of a hillock, they saw the main road a short distance below. The jawans, keeping Rangchwanga and his colleagues in the middle, came down from the hillock one by one in a line and came to the main road. After a while, a few military vans came along the road, and the jawans got into them and went to the camp with the captured Mizo rebels in glory.

Sema and his colleagues, near Bairengti, attacked the enemy forces just like Rangchwanga and his men. But unable to withstand the massive and reckless counter-attack of the enemy forces, they were forced to retreat. From the side of Bairengti, they advanced north-east along the road through the jungle. Due to the heavy losses incurred by the rebels due to their repeated surprise attacks, the security forces had further consolidated themselves. They had used massive force to completely subdue the rebels. For a few Mizo rebel youths to fight face to face with the huge army and abundant war materials of the enemy forces meant pushing themselves into the mouth of a cannon. Considering that, Sema and his colleagues broke off the engagement and continued to move north-east through the jungle. After covering a long distance in this way for two days, when they came to a hillock, their whole bodies were becoming numb. The entire entrails of their stomachs were twisting with the pangs of hunger.

The Rukni river was flowing past the hillock. Although the current of the river was not strong, the water was flowing downwards with a murmuring sound. Sema and his other colleagues went down to the river and drank some water to refresh themselves. Then they all went up to the hillock and sat down together. The gurgling sound of the flowing water and the chirping of various birds on the hill created a new wave of sound that was very pleasant in that natural environment. Sitting in that pleasant environment, Sema and his colleagues began to think about what to do. We have come a long way after being unable to fight them. Now it will be difficult to contact the main force early in the morning.

— Yes, the way the military has been brought and released here. It seems that all the military of the whole country has been brought to finish us.

— The bastards have set up camps every now and then. If we don't move around very carefully, they can catch us.

— So that they can't catch us, we should not go near the main road for two miles. Even if it is difficult, we have to go around through the deep jungle. It doesn't matter if it takes more time.

— But what about the rations if we go around? The entire entrails of the stomach are already twisting with the pangs of hunger.

What about the rations? This is the biggest question. Having moved far away from the place of operation, they have been temporarily cut off from the communication-maintaining force. As a result, the problem of supplying rations is the most important. Rations will not be available without connecting with the communication-maintaining force. But it is not possible to establish a connection quickly now. Somehow, they have to collect rations themselves now.
The sun was still far from reaching the middle of the sky. The chirping of the birds had gradually faded away. But the gurgling sound of the flowing Rukni water was still coming. After a long discussion, Sema and the others slowly walked down along the bank of the river. After walking for a while, they saw that on the other side of the river, where it flowed into the plains, there was a small village with a few small houses. There were fields nearby and cows and goats were grazing. The village was Tulartal. The Rukni river, flowing from the Mizo hills, passed by this village. This village, which is part of the Forest Reserve, is located on the last border of the Cachar district. There, the river marks the boundary between Cachar and the Mizo hills. The place where one first sets foot after crossing the Rukni river, where the boundary of the last house of the last village of the Forest Reserve, Tulartal, ends, is located in the Mizo hills. Although the village is located on the last border of the Cachar district, the modern transportation system is useless there. At least from a distance of seven miles, one has to salute the machine-driven wheeled vehicle. The inhabitants here have to adopt the primitive and natural method of walking to move through the forest.
Standing on the Mizo border on the bank of the Rukni river, Sema and his colleagues were looking at the small village on the other side of the river. What if we go to this village and ask the people for some rations? He was thinking to himself. Let's go.

— Let's go to the other side and ask the villagers for some rations.

— Will they give us?

— If they don't, we'll come back.

— But what if they try to detain us, thinking we are enemies?

— No, if something like that happens, we have our firearms. We will remember our firearms. Saying this, Sema and his force crossed the river and landed in Tulartal village. Seeing seven armed Mizos coming into the village one by one in a line, a stir spread among the villagers. Thanks to the government's propaganda machine, everyone in the area had the good fortune of knowing many different things about the story of the Mizo rebels.
The Mizos have come, the Mizos have come. If you want to live, you can't stay here anymore. The cry of "flee, flee" spread all over the village. Terrified, without looking back, old and young, children and adults, everyone was running towards the north. There is no other way but to flee from here. As they went, they spread the same message in the neighboring villages. In a moment, the village of Tulartal became empty. Then the Bagewala basti. For fear of their lives, everyone went to the benevolent officer of that area, the sahib of the Hawaithang beat office. The Semas had not thought that such an unexpected situation would arise upon entering the village. Anyway, the people have fled for their lives. For the time being, there is no question of any obstruction from them. Sema thought that now they would surely surrender to some third power. With their help, the number one tool for maintaining the administrative system, the police and military, will come to this region to resist the Mizos. Of course, by then, if some rations can be found, they can be taken and they can slip away.

Sema said to his colleagues, "Since things are moving in this direction, why should we go back empty-handed? Let's see if we can find anything in their houses."

— That's a good idea, let's take whatever we can find.
The seven Mizo rebels went into the small houses with thatched roofs surrounded by bamboo fences in the village and started searching one by one. But alas. There was nothing to take.

A tired colleague, after searching, said - "Damn, their condition is worse than ours."

— Yes, from the condition of the houses, it seems that the people probably survive by eating air.

After searching all the houses in Tulartal, it seemed to them that they had been harassing themselves for nothing all this time. So they went a little further to the Bagewala basti. The same situation was there too. So they thought that there was no point in going further like this, rather it could be a security risk. That's why the seven Mizo rebels did an about-turn and started walking back the way they had come. On their way, they saw a few cows and calves grazing in a field in Tulartal village. Perhaps because they were ordinary animals, they had not heard the story of the activities of the Mizo rebels propagated by the government's propaganda machine. That's why they were grazing fearlessly in the field. Seeing the cows and calves, Sema thought that they would have to be used to provide some rations for the Mizo rebel force. On the eve of leaving the village and entering the Mizo district, they caught two or three cows and calves and, dragging them, Sema and his colleagues advanced towards the deep jungle.

The babu at the Hawaithang beat office was relaxing when he saw crowds of old and young, children and adults, coming in a procession. Seeing them coming, the babu sahib thought to himself, "Why are they coming together again? Are they coming to demand a reduction in the days of forced labor or some other demand?" No, it doesn't seem so from their faces. There is a look of fear on everyone's face. Everyone is terrified. The babu got up from his comfortable chair and, like a babu, came and asked them.

— What happened? Why are you all coming in a procession like this?
A few elders from the group came forward and said to the babu,

— Babu, the Mizos have come and are attacking our village.

— The Mizos?

— Yes, babu, the Mizo rebels have come and started looting our village.

— So how many Mizos have come?

— There will be many, babu. Everyone is coming with their guns raised and making noise.

— Which way did they come?

— There, babu, they came from the jungle, crossing the Rukni river. Perhaps by now they have burned our houses to ashes.

Terrible news. If the Mizo rebels have attacked the Tulartal Bagewala basti, then they will come here very soon. Then what is the way out? The news made the babu sahib very uneasy. A solution has to be found quickly somehow. The news has to be sent to the head office in Silchar. The babu sahib, being very worried, went to make arrangements, that is, to send the news.

— Hello, sir?

— Hello, what happened?

— Sir, the Mizos have come and are attacking, sir.

— The Mizos?

— Yes sir, the Mizos.

— Where are the Mizos attacking?

— Sir, the Mizo rebels are attacking our Tulartal Bagewala basti. — Where is the Tulartal Bagewala basti?

— Our Hawaithang forest beat is under the Tulartal Bagewala basti, sir.

— So what kind of attack have the Mizos launched?

— Sir, they have entered the basti and are firing indiscriminately and burning all the houses, sir.

— Are they killing people?

— It seems so, sir. But I can't say how many, sir. All the people of the Tulartal Bagewala basti have come and gathered at Hawaithang, sir. Perhaps the Mizos are advancing further towards us.

— Okay, so what should I do now?

— I have informed you of the news, sir. Please make some arrangements, sir. The situation here is very serious, sir.

— Okay, I am informing the authorities. Okay sir, okay. Putting down the phone, the beat officer thought to himself, "Well, I have passed the news to the big babu at the head office. Now something will surely be done." Of course, he is not at ease even after giving the news. He is spending every moment in anxiety.

Anyway, following the procedures and policies of the bureaucracy completely, the news finally reached the security department, and then, of course, after a lot of effort, the force came to the field to keep the morale of the people high and to deal with the Mizo rebels. But in the end, it was like a lot of fuss about nothing. No evidence of arson, looting, etc. was found in the Bagewala basti. Of course, later, when a census of the cows was taken in the Tulartal basti, it was found that the number had decreased by a few compared to before.

After this incident, perhaps keeping in mind the saying "there is no end to caution," the security forces have set up a permanent military camp in the Bagewala basti. They have dug trenches around the camp and have built a house on a machan about fifty feet high, in which a vigilant guard is always posted. After its establishment, it does not seem that any vigilant guard has seen the tip of a Mizo rebel's hair, other than enjoying the breeze and the ever-changing beauty of the distant natural scenery.
