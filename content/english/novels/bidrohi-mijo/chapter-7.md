General Thu-Aya and Yangaya were sitting in a secret hideout, talking. Jitinga is the one who can tell the most about all the incidents that have happened in different areas of the Mizo hills. Yangaya and Thu-Aya are waiting for Jitinga. In the hope of getting a rough picture of the events of the past days, Jitinga arrived a little late for the scheduled time while Yangaya and Thu-Aya were talking. As soon as he arrived, Thu-Aya said to Jitinga,

— Hey, you seem to be a little late today.

— Yes, I am late. But I don't think I am too late.

— No, not too late. Anyway, tell me, what's the news?

— I have come to tell you the news. I will tell you all the news, just wait a little. Let me rest for a while.

— Okay, sit down. Rest. Do you want a bylo?

— Give me one.

Thu-Aya took out a bylo from his pocket and gave one to Jitinga. He himself and Yangaya also lit one each. With the pleasure of smoking a bylo, Jitinga said,

— The news is not particularly good.

— Why, what happened?

— Rangchwanga and his colleague have been caught.

— Caught?

— Yes, caught. They were all caught unharmed and taken to the military camp. When they could not extract any other information from them even after torturing them a lot there, they were sent as prisoners outside the Mizo district.

— Was Rangchwanga with his colleagues near Thingdawl?

— Yes.

The news of Rangchwanga's capture, though not unusual, was unexpected. It would not have happened if they had not made a big mistake to be caught all together unharmed. They must have made a big mistake somewhere, otherwise they would not have been caught like this. Anyway, since they have made a mistake, they will have to pay for it to some extent. But our force has to learn from this incident. Thinking all this, Thu-Aya said again - "You have told the story of Rangchwanga's disaster, what about the other news?"

— The other news is also not particularly good.

— Not good, meaning?

— Not good means that the school boys from Bhagabazar, Kabuganj in Cachar, across the last border of the Mizo district, have all gone on strike. Their complaint is that the Mizos are entering Cachar and shooting and killing ordinary people.

— The Mizos are entering Cachar and shooting and killing ordinary people?

— That is their complaint.

— From what I have heard, Sema was fighting with the enemy forces near Bairengti. But thinking that it would not be convenient to fight with their large number of forces for a long time, he started to retreat. In the end, it so happened that the communication-maintaining force could not maintain contact with them. Then the Semas faced a shortage of rations. So they went to the Tulartal and Bagewala bastis on the other side of the Rukni river, past Natachhara. Thinking that they might be able to get some food from the inhabitants there. But the inhabitants of the plains there, out of fear, started fleeing the village as soon as they saw the Semas. The Semas, of course, could not get anything else from that village and brought a few cows from the open field.

Hearing this report from Jitinga, Yangaya then said — "From what you have said, it is understood that it is not true that the Mizos are entering the plains and shooting and killing ordinary people."

— No, it is not true that they are entering the plains and shooting and killing ordinary people. But they are complaining that in a place called Dhalakhal, further east of Natachhara, the Mizos allegedly caught a college student, tied him to a tree, and shot him dead. That is why the students of the schools and colleges there are on strike in protest of the student's murder.

— Then surely the common people there have a negative attitude towards us?

— Yes, it is natural to have a negative attitude.

— Propaganda is already being spread against us through all kinds of propaganda machines. And now, in this incident, they will provoke them even more against us with emotion.

General Thu-Aya thought that the reaction to the Semas' entry into the Tulartal and Bagewala bastis was more harmful than the capture of the Rangchwangas. Because the reactionary forces are already always looking for ways to brutally suppress the Mizos. At that time, if such an incident happens that they can use as a weapon to provoke the people, then they will use it completely. The reactionary forces will surely use the matter of the Tulartal and Bagewala bastis as a good weapon. They will probably show this incident and say, "Look at the courage of the jungle bastards! They have crossed the Mizo district and are now attacking the plains." All these thoughts were rising one after another in General Thu-Aya's mind. Today, it has to be conveyed to the people of the plains that this armed movement of the Mizo rebels is a movement for the development of national identity, this movement is a movement for freedom. The success of the movement will not only bring success to the Mizos, this movement will expose the true face of the reactionary ruling apparatus to the people of the plains. In this case, while conducting the movement of the Mizo rebels, the support of the people of the plains has to be brought. Therefore, nothing should be done that could create a negative attitude towards the Mizo rebels among the people of the plains. Whatever the purpose of Sema's visit to the Tulartal and Bagewala bastis with his colleagues, the reactionary group will temporarily provoke the ordinary people of the plains against the Mizos by using that as a pretext.
The entire Mizo Hills region has been handed over to the security forces to suppress the Mizo rebels. But the Mizos, who are participating in the armed struggle by consolidating new strength every day, cannot be suppressed in any way. It is spreading from one end to the other like a wave. The new group is coming forward to fill the void of those who are caught by the enemy today while fighting. Frightened by the growing strength of the Mizo rebels, the government is adopting the policy followed by the imperialists to suppress the rebels. In order to completely isolate those who are engaged in daily struggle with arms from the others, the government is forcibly bringing all the inhabitants of the Mizo hills and putting them in the Protected and Progressive Villages created by the government.

Hitler's extermination of the Jews is not unknown to anyone today. The story of the brutal murder of millions of Jews, young and old, in concentration camps sends a shiver down the spine of any sane person. The imperialists also condemn the infamous history of Hitler's inhuman extermination of the Jews. But does that mean that a repetition of events like Hitler's brutal atrocities is not happening even today? Hitler is not there, nor is his concentration camp. But the brutal method of oppression and persecution to serve one's own interests, to suppress others, is still there. Rather, the imperialists and their servants are oppressing the people of the freedom-loving countries in a more brutal way than Hitler's method of mass genocide.

They are pushing them to their deaths. The imperialists are unjustly interfering in the freedom-loving countries and killing the people there on a large scale. They are catching people and putting them in cages. By creating Strategic Hamlets, they are trapping the people in them and pushing them towards a slow death. What is the fundamental difference between the Nazi concentration camps and the Strategic Hamlets created by the imperialists? The Nazi forces would achieve their purpose in a moment. They would catch the Jews and extinguish their lives in an instant. And what is American imperialism doing today? When future generations will take stock of history, they will see that the brutal oppression of the American imperialist forces is in no way less than the brutal oppression of the Nazi forces. Today, the P.P.V.s in the Mizo district have also been created in the style of the Strategic Hamlets of the American imperialists. An attempt is being made to suppress the fighting people of Vietnam by trapping them in the Strategic Hamlets. The purpose is to isolate the Viet Cong and destroy them completely. But alas! The huge Yankee forces themselves are delivering the message to the Viet Cong. With the firm self-confidence to free their motherland, the people of a small country are harassing the largest imperialist country in the world, America. They are proving by carrying on an armed struggle that no matter how huge the imperialist power is, today imperialism is being forced to admit defeat to the small freedom-loving countries.

PPVs have been created on the side of the main road from Silchar to Aizawl and on the side of the road from Aizawl to Lunglei. Thousands of Mizos, who have been living in various punjees since the time of their ancestors, have been evicted from those punjees and men, women, and children have been forcibly brought and gathered in the PPVs without any discrimination. In the first instance, eighteen PPVs were created and a total of sixty thousand Mizo men and women were forced to live there by force. Referring to the gathering of people in the PPVs after evicting them from their ancestral homes, a journalist wrote that,

— The relocation of Mizo villagers from their ancestral lands to new settlements has been met with considerable sorrow, as no population transfer can ever be entirely without contention. Despite official assurances that the Mizo people have been successfully relocated and are now content in their new homes, the reality is that they long for their former abodes, which hold the memories of their ancestors.

Each PPV is guarded by military personnel. Every person living there has to go to a specific area with the permission of the military authorities and has to return from that area at a specific time. Any deviation from that is a problem. Just as American imperialism is not able to suppress the people of Vietnam even by adopting the policy of "Kill all, burn all, and destroy all," here too the government's ruling apparatus is not able to suppress the Mizos by detaining them in the PPVs. It has not been able to isolate the fighting Mizo rebels from the general Mizo population. The major newspapers are constantly admitting that the fighting Mizo rebels are regularly receiving money and other help from the people of Aizawl town in the Mizo hills, that is, where the government has established the main center of its administrative system to suppress the Mizo rebels. It is not that they receive money and other help only from the regions located deep inside the hills. They also receive help in various ways from the thousands of Mizos detained in the PPVs. In this way, even after detaining the people in the PPVs, the administrative group is getting more and more angry for not being able to isolate the Mizo rebels.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Kumaramangalam, once came to inspect the PPVs. He praised the establishment of the administrative system by creating the PPVs. The government used to give rations to the Mizos in the PPVs. A few days after the Commander-in-Chief of the Army inspected the PPVs and left, the rations for the sixty thousand Mizos were stopped. While talking about this, a periodical wrote,

Upon a visit from Kumarmangalam, the Indian Army's Chief of Staff, who commended the PPVs' efficient operation, the reactionary Indian rulers swiftly implemented an inhumane measure: they completely halted food rations for the 60,000 inmates of the PPVs.

But despite all this, they could not stop the armed campaign of the brave Mizo rebels. They are continuing their attacks from ambush at an unabated pace. They are blowing up the outposts of the military forces. They are snatching rifles by launching surprise attacks. They are repeatedly foiling the arrangements of the administrators. This is also making the administrative group angry, thinking that the fighting Mizo rebels must be completely isolated from the general population. All kinds of communication must be stopped. So that they cannot collect food and other necessary things from the neighboring areas in any way. In this way, they have to be isolated and starved to death. To implement all this, the administrative group adopts a course of action. What the course of action will be, a reactionary group's newspaper mentioned while writing,

— Shillong reports indicate that an additional 40,000 Mizo villagers are to be relocated to progressive villages as part of a new regrouping operation. This initiative, expected to conclude within two months, aims to provide Mizos with enhanced security, protection, and access to modern farming facilities. Currently, 237,000 Mizo villagers have already been settled in these regrouped progressive villages, benefiting from improved security and development. The district's total population is 350,000. The decision to restart population transfers was made at a high-level meeting in Shillong, where Lt. Gen. Arora briefed attendees on the current situation in the Mizo hills and stressed the necessity of further village regrouping due to recent incursions by armed Mizo rebels.

General Thu-Aya's thoughts had gone far, centered on Jitinga's report. If Thu-Aya had been alone, that thought might have continued to get more and more entangled, but since Jitinga and Yangaya were by his side, that was not possible. Yangaya interrupted his thoughts by asking a question. He said — "I think the ruling class is applying the 'divide and rule' policy on us."

— In what way?

— They have divided them into two groups: the rebels and the loyal followers of the government. They will tell those who have been brought and detained in the PPVs, "Look, this is your condition because of the Mizo rebels. You have been brought and gathered in the PPVs to save you from their oppression and torture. If the rebels had not carried out such an armed struggle, you would not have faced such sorrow and hardship. The sorrow and hardship you are suffering today is all because of the rebels."

— They can constantly carry out such propaganda in the PPVs to create a negative attitude towards the armed Mizos participating in the liberation war. It may also be that they will carry out propaganda through various propaganda machines outside the Mizo district that the loyal Mizos are being forced to leave their ancestral punjees, being tormented by the atrocities of the Mizo rebels. That is why the government is creating new settlements for them, keeping their security in mind. The PPVs are a new name for the safe settlements of the loyal Mizos.

— No matter what they propagate inside or outside, daily experience will guide our people on the right path.

— That is true. Our experience will help us to move forward on the right path.

However, their propaganda according to their will will temporarily confuse the outsiders about our struggle. Of course, when our struggle reaches a high level, that struggle itself will deliver the correct message to the outsiders.

Thu-Aya and Yangaya were talking continuously. Jitinga did not participate in their conversation. He was listening attentively. After Yangaya and Thu-Aya stopped talking, Jitinga continued to speak almost like a speech. He said that, in fact, after 1947, the great India has today become a prison house for various ethnic groups. The increasing exploitation and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and comprador capitalists are pushing the lives of various ethnic groups and hill tribes into unbearable sorrow and hardship. They are rapidly losing their harmony and livelihood under the increasing pressure. Today, the Mizos are also being exploited very brutally. The socio-economic review of the Assam government shows that the Mizos are burdened with the pressure of loans at very high interest rates. On average, each Mizo family is indebted for one hundred and thirty-two rupees a year. Before 1947, the Mizos used to carry on their general business in the neighboring regions. But due to the partition of the country, all those regions are now in East Pakistan. As a result, all business connections with those previous regions have been severed. To date, no alternative market has been found where business can be carried on like there. This is hampering the economic condition of the Mizos. How much attention is the government paying to that today? How much is the government's propaganda machine publicizing the plight of the Mizos compared to how vocal it is against the armed campaign that has been launched to get rid of the persecution? From what it is propagating and the measures it is taking, we can understand that they are doing what the British imperialists did against the fighters of the national liberation movement of Malaya. They are doing what the American imperialists are doing against the Viet Cong. At present, they are doing what the Nehru government first did in Telangana in 1948 against the armed struggle of the peasants and later against the national liberation movement of the Nagas.

If various ethnic groups and the inhabitants of other regions stand up against persecution and oppression and declare a rebellion to overthrow the tools of exploitation and persecution, then the ruling class has been making efforts to deal with them for a long time. After 1962, soldiers were selected and given special training to conduct anti-guerrilla warfare so that they could suppress the guerrilla warfare followed in the liberation movements of various ethnic groups. But despite all this, the angry Mizo liberation fighters are using the soldiers trained in anti-guerrilla warfare like banana leaf soldiers. The Mizo-Kuki rebels have blown up the bridge on the Dimapur-Imphal highway. They have caught and punished five informers of the reactionaries from an area next to the Kalaspur jungle. Twenty Mizo rebels ambushed and wounded the soldiers with great success in the Nahlan region of the Mizo district. A major of the enemy forces was killed in a surprise attack. But the authorities did not publicize the extent of their losses. They are afraid to publicize the story of the victory of the Mizo rebels through their propaganda machine. Who knows, that victory story might inspire others and they too might be inspired to follow the path of the Mizo rebels. Therefore, it is better to suppress the story of the victory campaign of the Mizo rebels, the purpose and statement of their liberation movement, as much as possible, without publicizing it.

But the nature of armed struggle is such that it breaks through everything and comes out with the real truth on its own. The real truth cannot be hidden by suppressing it in various ways. If that were not the case, how would the story of the victory campaign of the Viet Cong of Vietnam resonate in the minds of the American people? Why does the American public form public opinion against the American imperialists' interference in Vietnam? Does American imperialism loudly proclaim that they are unjustly oppressing the Viet Cong? Surely not. The high level of the armed struggle of the Viet Cong itself spreads their news everywhere. In trying to deal with the blow of the armed struggle, the imperialists are forced to reveal some real truths.

The case of the Mizos is also somewhat similar. They do not say that unjust oppression is being carried out on the Mizos, that the Mizos are truly fit for their all-round independence. Rather, they carry on the opposite propaganda that what the Mizo rebels have done is wrong. Their unjust demand cannot be accepted in any way. If they do not abandon their path, then it will surely be suppressed. No matter how brutal the method or system of suppression may be. But despite all this, the real news of the Mizo rebels is coming out.
