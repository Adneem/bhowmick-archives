The sun was gradually setting in the western sky. Yangaya, Jitinga, and another colleague were slowly advancing along the winding, serpentine road built through the impenetrable, jungle-covered region of the mountains. In the distance, the sun's rays were scattered in various ways on the mountain peaks. In a moment, their colors were changing and gradually fading. They had to reach the Sailo punjee before the darkness of the night engulfed them. Jitinga had initially thought that due to his long stay abroad, Yangaya might have difficulty walking on this difficult path. But in fact, Yangaya was keeping pace with them just fine. There was no extra sign of fatigue on his face. He was walking in step towards the hideout in the Sailo punjee.

General Thu-Aya, Jaichoanga, Rema, and other colleagues from every region had already gathered. This gathering was much like attending a party. This was a new kind of party for the Mizo rebels. The social environment created by those who are involved in the daily struggle with the firm determination to continue the fight against the enemy forces, and the need for আনন্দ উৎসব (ananda utsav - festival of joy) that arises in the midst of work, is the reason for organizing such parties. The purpose of the Mizo rebels' party is naturally of a different taste and a different pattern from that of the military bigwigs or others who attend parties. The exchange of experiences gained in the past by carrying out সংগ্রামী অভিযান (sangrami abhiyan - revolutionary campaigns) and the discussion of the programs that will be implemented in the coming days are the main topics of discussion in this new kind of party.

Everyone who had gathered at the hideout knew each other. The only exception was Yangaya. Those who had previously heard that Yangaya had come but had never seen him, understood at a glance that the new person was Yangaya. Everyone welcomed Yangaya with a smile and felt happy at his presence. But ignoring everyone's joy, Rema embraced his friend, with whom he had been united in one soul and one mind from his adolescence to the beginning of his youth. He stood silently in an embrace. He was so overwhelmed with joy that he could not say anything. Only a few drops of tears of joy rolled down his eyes. Yangaya is not easily moved by emotion, but at this moment, the sincere love of his old friend made him a little weak. Still, he composed himself and, pulling his friend, sat down side by side on the machan inside the house. A lantern was hung from a rope from the top in the middle of the room. Its dim light was spreading enough light in that environment. General Thu-Aya, Jaichoanga, Jitinga, and a few other colleagues took their seats on the machan inside the room after Rema and Yangaya. Only four colleagues remained outside. Two of them would arrange for the night's meal in a small hut next door, and the other two would patrol. Although no one from the security forces would be able to guess that the Mizo rebels were having a meeting here, this arrangement was kept in place as a strategic measure for security. Rema took out a bylo from his pocket and gave it to Yangaya. Yangaya was very happy to get a bylo after a long time. While he was abroad, he had smoked cigarettes. At first, he used to crave for a bylo. Later, of course, it was not so much of a problem. Lighting the bylo and exhaling the smoke, old memories floated in Yangaya's mind. While he was in Shillong, when Yangaya was smoking a bylo sitting in a tea shop next to the college, a Bengali classmate had said to Yangaya,

— Hello Mr., what brand of cigarette are you smoking?
Then Yangaya had told the boy,

— This is our native brand. We call it Bailoo, this is made of a special kind of tobacco which grows plenty in our Mizo Hills.

— What a nice smell is coming out of it! Will you please offer me one?

— Why not! you take more than one, saying this, he had offered his classmate two or three bylos. The boy was very happy and was examining the bylos closely. How it was crushed and rolled in a newspaper like a mixer. Like that college classmate, Yangaya had to tell many people about this bylo many times.

Jitinga could not tolerate seeing Rema only giving a bylo to Yangaya and smoking it himself with pleasure. He doesn't smoke much himself, but he can't stand seeing others smoke in front of him. It's as if he is overcome by a strong craving. So he said to Rema - "Hey, is it enough for you and your friend to smoke? Don't we have a craving? Give it, give it. Give it to us." Saying this, he almost snatched the bylos from Rema and gave them one by one to Jaichoanga and everyone else. He did it in such a way that everyone found it very funny and made a fool of Rema. Seeing that everyone was enjoying it and laughing, Rema also laughed. But his laughter looked foolish.

After some time had passed in this way, General Thu-Aya formally started the meeting. First, he started talking about Yangaya. Although many knew Yangaya's past and the purpose of his coming here now, Thu-Aya, according to custom, told everyone in this public meeting that although Yangaya had not directly joined our armed struggle, he is one of us and from now on he is a true warrior of our armed struggle. He is a part of our struggle. Our path and his path are one and the same.

Saying this, Thu-Aya turned to Yangaya and smiled at his assenting expression. He turned his gaze back and said to everyone, "I have said this much about Yangaya. He will give his own speech later. Now we will discuss and express our opinions on the events of our past days."

After General Thu-Aya, Jaichoanga began to narrate one by one the stories of the victories of the various platoons of their division in ambush attacks. He said, — "Among all the ambush attacks we have carried out so far, the one led by General Thu-Aya was the most significant. All five military-laden vans were victims of the attack. And we also collected some weapons from them. Besides that, the rest were not so strong."

Jaichoanga finished his speech by saying these words. Then Jitinga started to present his speech. He said, "The way our armed forces are fighting, our victories are more than our losses. As a result, the authorities of the security forces are getting angry and bewildered. That's why they are arresting the residents in and around the city. Now the condition of those who are living a normal life is becoming unbearable. Without any reason, they suddenly come and surround the entire punjee and arrest them as M.N.F. volunteers. The elderly, thirteen-year-old boys, and even pregnant women are not being spared. They think that all Mizos are somehow supporting the rebels, ignoring the government. Moreover, from the authorities of the security forces to the ordinary soldiers, they are carrying out unspeakable, barbaric, and brutal atrocities on Mizo girls."

Hearing Jitinga's words, a strong feeling of revenge arose in everyone's mind. The unspeakable atrocities of the soldiers of the security forces floated before their eyes. They could see the pathetic cries of helpless sixteen-year-old Mizo girls who had fallen into the clutches of the barbaric beasts. The inhuman torture of the military authorities on the octogenarian old and the young. The more these things floated in their minds, the more every nerve and vein in their bodies resonated, and a strong feeling of revenge arose in their minds. They were thinking,

— No, we will take revenge for this. No matter what obstacles come our way.

Rema was also thinking. He broke away from his thoughts and, breaking the silence of the entire room, said, — "We are fighting for our freedom. And they? They are duly enforcing law and order to maintain the sovereignty and integrity of the country."

— We are feeling the effects of the due enforcement of law and order to the core. Jitinga said. – Yes, it is in the name of upholding the dignity of law and order that the forces of the holy government physically torture Mizo girls. They crush the bones of the hands and feet of old Mizo men. They wipe out various punjees.

General Thu-Aya had been listening attentively to the conversation all this time. Now he opened his mouth. He said, — "The atrocities they are carrying out on our mothers, brothers, and sisters are natural. As time goes on, they will become even more enraged. When a nation plunges into a national liberation movement, the ruling class naturally takes any measure to suppress it. No matter how gruesome that measure may be. This has been seen in the history of various countries of the world. The more we advance our struggle, the more desperate they will become to suppress us. But in the end, they will not be able to. Because, no matter how small a country is in size, a large enemy cannot suppress it if the entire population of the country fights extensively against that enemy. Therefore, today we have to adopt a program to spread our struggle extensively." After speaking for a long time without a break, Thu-Aya stopped and took a bylo from a colleague and lit it.

Yangaya had been listening to everyone's words from the beginning. The discussions of Jaichoanga, Jitinga, Rema, and Thu-Aya, who participated in the discussion, all seemed very important to him. Of course, General Thu-Aya's speech made a greater impression on his mind. Because, in his opinion, there was a direction in Thu-Aya's speech on how to advance the revolutionary consciousness. Although Thu-Aya's speech gave direction to the revolutionary consciousness and the discussions of others were important, Yangaya thought that everyone had omitted a particular topic from the discussion. What kind of influence is the armed struggle that the Mizo rebels are carrying out in the Mizo district today to protect the dignity of their self-proclaimed independent Mizoram having outside the Mizo district? How are others looking at it? These questions have been omitted from the discussion. So Yangaya wanted to discuss these questions. He addressed all his colleagues and said, "What is the publicity of our struggle outside the Mizo district? What are the people outside thinking about our struggle?"

Yangaya's question attracted General Thu-Aya the most. He was smoking a bylo. Hearing Yangaya's question, he exhaled the smoke of the bylo and said with a laugh - "The message of our struggle is surely being spread outside. Different people are thinking about our struggle. In that, different people are propagating it from different perspectives, thinking in different ways. Many are thinking that a nation should develop with its own identity, that it should be completely free from the shackles of subjugation. Let it be truly independent. They are surely showing sympathy for our struggle. Those who do not want us to be independent are propagating against us. They are saying that we are puppets in the hands of the missionaries. We are being instigated to fight this battle. We have no characteristics of our own. A third party is using us from behind like a bullock in an oil-press to undermine the sovereignty and integrity of the government, to harass the government. Moreover, they are propagating so that a negative attitude develops towards us among the general inhabitants of the plains. They are propagating that we are hill savages, how can we be independent again? What do we understand about independence? And so on."

— "No matter what people of different opinions say for or against us, can't we propagate something from our side to the outside?" As soon as Thu-Aya stopped, Yangaya asked again.

— "That can be done. Our people can go outside and propagate our views. But that propagation will have no value if we can strengthen the armed struggle that we are carrying out in our Mizoram. The story of the struggle of the fighting people of Vietnam has reached all the countries of the world today. Today, public opinion is being formed in America in favor of the Vietnamese fighting people, and that has been possible because the Vietnamese fighting people are carrying on an uncompromising struggle. I think the more we can inspire our people with patriotism and carry on the struggle to corner the enemy forces, the more our fighting character will naturally be propagated outside. The people of any freedom struggle cannot go outside and pray for the mercy of others by simply telling stories of sorrow without fighting. Therefore, our first and foremost task now is to advance our struggle. To bring our people extensively into our just struggle."

What General Thu-Aya said in response to Yangaya's question seemed very reasonable. Thu-Aya's speech began to work on everyone's mind, and they thought, "The victory of the struggle will propagate us to the people of the world. We will fight in our own way. We will fight with our own strength. With that, we will prove what we understand about independence. We are not puppets in the hands of others, but self-reliant."

In this way, a lot of time passed in the midst of discussion and thought. It was almost ten o'clock at night. The colleagues who were given the responsibility of preparing the night's meal came and said that the food was ready. As soon as they heard that the food was ready, Rema said - "Then let's eat it hot, otherwise it will get cold in this cold."

— "Yes, yes, we have to get hot. So it's good to eat hot." Jitinga said with a laugh to make Rema's words effective and gestured to his colleagues to bring the pots and pans.

Everyone sat in a circle with the food in the middle. Everyone took rice and pork from the pots and pans with their own hands and started eating with relish. While eating, Rema looked at Yangaya and said, — "Hey, how do you like it?"

— "It's good." Yangaya said. He was eating slowly. In between eating, he said to Rema, — "We have to be very tolerant and each of us has to be as far-sighted as Thu-Aya." Rema said while eating, — "Hmm." Jitinga was sitting next to Rema and Yangaya. He did not let Rema continue and, taking up Yangaya's question, said, — "What you have said is right. We have to be tolerant. If we involve ourselves deeply with the struggle, the experience of the struggle will help us to analyze the real situation correctly. It will make our thinking correct. But if we don't eat, we can't do anything. So now is the time to eat, so eat."

Everyone laughed at Jitinga's last words. This is Jitinga's way. He always tries to make everyone laugh. He pushes and pushes the serious discussions and presents them in front of everyone in such a way that everyone can't help but laugh.

In this way, the night progressed with eating with relish and talking with humor. After the meal was over, the meeting would continue for some more time. If any question arose in their minds, the colleagues would discuss it in detail and try to solve it. And everyone would understand their respective responsibilities for carrying on the struggle in the coming days. Before the light of dawn peeked in the eastern sky, everyone would leave this secret meeting place of the Sailo punjee and reach their respective designated places.
