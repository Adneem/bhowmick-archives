It was about eight o'clock at night. A winter night. The surroundings were covered in fog. Nothing could be seen when one went out of the house. There was a sense of silence all over the area. Rema went out of the house once, and after being hit by a gust of cold, he came back inside and sat by the fireplace. Rosangi had almost finished preparing the dinner. Just then, Jitinga pushed the door and entered. To protect himself from the severity of the cold, he had covered his body with warm clothes in such a way that only his face was visible, and at a glance, even his closest relatives would not be able to recognize that he was actually Jitinga. Both Rema and Rosangi looked at the newcomer carefully.

— Hey, from the way you are looking, it seems you are seeing something new. Can't you recognize me? Jitinga said.

— Hearing Jitinga's voice, Rema and Rosangi recognized him. But because he had covered his body in a strange and peculiar dress, despite being very close to him, Rema and Rosangi were a little embarrassed for not being able to recognize Jitinga at first glance. But Jitinga was very happy about it.

He felt very happy at that moment that he had been able to fool them at first glance. He slowly took off his hat and sat down on a piece of wood next to the fireplace, close to Rema. Rema moved a little and welcomed him to sit. Rosangi, as if joking, said to Jitinga, — The way you have come dressed, one has to assume at first that you are a strange creature from a zoo. — To survive the attack of the cold outside, you too will have to dress up as a strange creature from a zoo. You are sitting comfortably by the fireplace in the house, so you don't understand anything.

— You are right, brother. The cold outside is terrible. I went out of the house once and then quickly came back inside and sat down. It's not cold, it's like an electric shock. Well, anyway, now tell me, friend, what is the reason for your visit? Rema said.

— I have come to give you some good news today. I can't just blurt it out. I have to say it slowly and with relish.

Saying this, Jitinga looked at both Rema and Rosangi and smiled. Rosangi and Rema know that this is Jitinga's way. Despite hundreds of obstacles, he never gets angry. There is always a smile on his face when he talks. That's why everyone loves him. Storms, cold attacks, and fear of the enemy, nothing can defeat him. He will deliver the news to the right place at the right time.

While the smile was still on Jitinga's face, Rosangi said - What good news do you have to give? Your news means that 5/6 of our men have been killed in a skirmish and seven have been injured. Otherwise, the enemy forces have surrounded the Lalbung punjee and arrested everyone, old and young, men and women, on suspicion of being M.N.F. volunteers. Is this good news?

— No, I have not come to give such news today. Today's news is different. Jitinga said with a smiling face.

Observing the way Jitinga and Rosangi's conversation was progressing, Rema thought that if the two of them continued like this, it would take a long time to know the real news. So she interrupted and said, — Friend, we don't need your wordplay right now, you tell us the real matter.

— The real matter is that Mr. Yangaya arrived in Aizawl day before yesterday.

— Yangaya has come?

— Yes, Yangaya has come. We will meet and talk with Yangaya in person within two or three days.
In the very near future, Rema will meet with Yangaya. They will talk. The joy of meeting a friend after a long time sent waves through his entire body and mind. Drawing on the joy, he let his mind sink into the memories of the distant past.

Yangaya was born in a small, secluded punjee on a hill next to Demagiri. Just as ordinary Mizo boys and girls grow up from childhood to adolescence in a hilly environment, Yangaya also grew up in the same way. Rema got to know Yangaya in his full adolescence. The bond of friendship between the two gradually strengthened. Both of them finished their matriculation classes in Aizawl town. The indomitable enthusiasm to unite themselves in the larger sphere of life pushed them to the hill town of Shillong. There, both of them enrolled in the intermediate class. After completing his intermediate studies, Yangaya went to the distant Kachin area of Burma, and Rema came to Aizawl. This happened ten years ago. After Yangaya went to the Kachin area, Rema felt very lonely. The characteristics of Yangaya's character would always peek into his mind again and again.

From the Kachin area, Yangaya took a job in the Burma Airforce. At that time, news would occasionally come to Rema that Yangaya was well-established in his job. He was not just an ordinary employee of the Burma Airforce. He was a skilled engineer. He had also improved a lot in sports. The young man who had won the praise of sports lovers by playing hockey in the city of Aizawl in the Mizo hills was a player of the Burma Airforce team. Rema used to feel very happy to receive this news. But after the fall of the U Nu government in Burma, he did not stay in Burma anymore. He had gone to London. After that, Rema did not receive any personal news of Yangaya. After living abroad for a long time, Yangaya has now returned to his homeland. But why? Does he not know that the Mizo hills are moving towards a historic change today? A new life has awakened in the minds of every patriotic Mizo boy and girl here. The once quiet and peaceful environment of the Mizo hills is now heated. The entire Mizo nation is facing a fiery ordeal today. In the name of protecting the sovereignty and integrity of the country, the soldiers of the full military force, under the name of security forces, are carrying out brutal oppression and injustice in every region of the Mizo hills. Does Yangaya know the exact news of all this? Has Yangaya come to know that the Mizo public life is in disarray? Otherwise, why has he left his comfortable and prosperous life and returned to this heated Mizo hills today? Surely, the call of the motherland has resonated strongly in Yangaya's mind today. Today, where the hill Mizo people have declared themselves independent, are fighting with all their might, ignoring all kinds of obstacles - children, young, old, everyone is initiated into the mantra of independence and is fighting with the security forces, in such a situation, Yangaya cannot live a comfortable and prosperous life sitting abroad. Yangaya surely knows that it is the great duty of every person to participate in a nation's national liberation movement. Therefore, as a true human being, Yangaya must participate in the nation's national liberation movement, that is, the freedom struggle. He will stand by Rema's side in the battlefield, saying "fear not". He will stand by every participant in the freedom struggle...

Although Rosangi and Jitinga were sitting next to Rema, ignoring them, Rema's mind was in turmoil about Yangaya. His mind was moving forward, centered on the topic of Yangaya.

Jitinga understood Rema's state of mind. So he said in a soft, calm voice, — It seems you have forgotten us after hearing the news of Yangaya. If you meet him, you probably won't let us get close to you. Rema was indeed thinking only about Yangaya, not giving due importance to Jitinga and Rosangi sitting in front of him. So Jitinga's question made him a little embarrassed. However, he composed himself and said simply — No, he is an old friend, so when his topic came up, many old memories came to mind.

— Sometimes, in my leisure time, old memories would float in my mind. When I give in to old memories, my mind becomes restless. Laziness and inertia somehow engross both the mind and the body. Then I have a lot of difficulty in cheering up my mind. That's why I don't give in to reminiscence anymore.

Jitinga's words seemed to be indirectly hinting to Rema that you should not be engrossed in the memories of the past. The harsh reality is pricking us to obstruct the great responsibility of shaping our future that has come upon us. We cannot afford to be engrossed in thinking only about the happy past. Rema understood Jitinga's hint. He said — Just as it is not right to be engrossed in the memories of the past, it is also not right to deny them. The future cannot be built by completely ignoring the past.

Rosangi had by then finished preparing the night's meal and made tea. She saw that Rema and Jitinga had left the topic of Yangaya and were engaged in a philosophical discussion. Now she needed to give them tea and change the course of their philosophical discussion. She kept one cup for herself and gave two cups of tea to the two of them. She said while giving the tea - Now let's leave the philosophical discussion and have some tea to refresh our bodies.

Receiving tea at this time, both Rema and Jitinga left their philosophical discussion and started drinking tea with satisfying sips. Rosangi had never seen Yangaya. She had heard about Yangaya from Rema. She had formed a rough idea about Yangaya. Yangaya has come to the country after a long time. Rema's old friend will stand by Rema's side in response to the call of the motherland and become a partner in the struggle. These thoughts filled Rosangi's mind and gave her great pleasure.

Slowly, the hands of the clock tick forward. Breaking the silence of the deep, foggy, dark night, the sound of dew drops falling from the leaves of the tree near Rema's house can be heard.

— Let's get up now. It's almost ten o'clock at night. Jitinga got up, put on his hat, and started to tighten his warm clothes.

— You're leaving? Rema said.

— Yes, I'm leaving. I came to give the news, and I have already told you.

— Today's news is really special news.

— I came because it is special news. Otherwise, would I have come out in this cold and walked a mile and a half?

— What can I say to you? Rema said in a very soft voice, feigning gratitude.

— Stop, stop, you don't have to be so polite. If you show too much gratitude, I will be punctured. I can't tolerate gas. Saying this, Jitinga pushed the door and went out.

Rosangi and Rema got up to the door to bid Jitinga a final farewell for the day. Jitinga came out of the house, turned back, and said to both Rema and Rosangi, "Mangthale," meaning good night. In reply, both Rema and Rosangi said together, "Mangthale." Outside the house, the entire area was covered in a strange darkness due to the fog. After saying goodbye and taking two or three steps, Jitinga's entire body disappeared into the darkness.
