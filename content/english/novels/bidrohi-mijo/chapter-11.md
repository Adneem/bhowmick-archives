After eating his morning meal, Rangchwanga lit a bidi and, as he was going from his own ward to another, he saw a familiar face whom he had seen in this jail a long time ago and stopped. Although his appearance had changed in a few years, it was not difficult to recognize him. Addressing him, he said,

— Hey, aren't you Thanglura?

— Yes, I am Thanglura.

— You have changed quite a bit.
— I have become a little fat. That's why you are having difficulty recognizing me.

— I am not having difficulty. If I had, I wouldn't have been able to call you Thanglura. I would have thought you were someone else and passed by. Anyway. I don't see you wandering around inside the jail these days. What's the matter?

— How would you see me? Was I here all this time for you to see me?

— Then where were you all this time?

— A few days after you, Zairema, and the others were smuggled out of here, I was also smuggled out of here with the others. First from here to Nagaon. From Nagaon to Tezpur, and from Tezpur, they have brought me here. I arrived last night. So, how are you?

— I am doing okay. After drinking the water of many jails, they have brought me here ten or twelve days ago.

— I can't figure out what the bastards will do with us.

— Yes, they have kept us confined, and besides, they are arresting new Mizo rebels every day and putting them in jail.

After hearing from Rangchwanga that new Mizos were being arrested and put in jail every day, Thanglura began to think to himself. He thought that the Mizo prisoners he could not recognize in the jail now were then new prisoners. Many of the Mizo prisoners he had seen when he was smuggled out of here before were not here now. Thinking all this, Thanglura said to Rangchwanga,

— Are all those whom I cannot recognize here new Mizo prisoners?

— Although not all of them are new prisoners, most of them are new. The old ones were sent elsewhere. Of course, some of the old ones have been brought here again. You know them.

— I know them more or less. But I am saying, are they just arresting Mizos continuously? Are they not releasing the old prisoners?

— I can see that they are arresting new ones. But I don't know if they have released any old prisoners. However, the jail authorities could not keep a few of them confined within the four walls. They have gone.

Rangchwanga said he did not know if any of the old prisoners had been released. Again, he says that a few have gone. Thanglura could not understand what these words exactly meant. He felt a kind of hitch. He said to Rangchwanga,

— Hey, you say once that no old ones have been released. Again you say that a few have gone, what kind of talk is that?

— Gone means their physical existence is no longer in the jail. They could not cope with the slow torture that had been going on in the jail for a long time. The persecution and torture were slowly pushing them towards death. One by one, a few Mizo prisoners died inside the jail. Although they were not released while they were alive, the death warrant took them away from the jail authorities. That's why I am saying that although no old prisoners were released, the authorities could not keep a few of them confined within the four walls.

Hearing all this from Rangchwanga, Thanglura could not decide what to say. He became absent-minded. A few images slowly began to float before his eyes. The faces of the few old Mizos whom Thanglura had seen here four long years ago floated before his eyes one by one. The old Mizos who had been arrested from areas like Bankan, Zembawk, Chehlang, and Pangzawl, separated from their young children and relatives, and kept in jail, although they did not speak much, the expression on their faces suggested that they were constantly thinking, "Why have they been so unjustly snatched away from their children and relatives and kept in jail?" They would think to themselves, "Why are they being oppressed in this way, they have done no wrong." They would delve into the events of their memory, examine them carefully, judge them, but no, they could not find any instance for which they had to endure such torture in jail. They had done no wrong themselves, yet they had to endure torture in jail. When they could not find any solution after thinking about it, sometimes a deep sigh would escape them unknowingly. Sometimes, seeing their helpless, pathetic look, it would seem that they were probably thinking of their young children whom they had left behind. They were suffering from the apprehension of their misfortune. They would suffer from the apprehension of the misfortune of their relatives by getting caught in a whirlwind of their own thoughts. And yet there was nothing they could do. Perhaps as a result of all these thoughts, a sad, helpless expression would always be visible on their faces.

Now, of course, the old Mizos who were brought as prisoners from areas like Bankan, Pangzawl, etc., no longer have that pathetic look. Unable to bear the oppression that was inflicted on them, they are losing their mental and physical balance and are gradually losing themselves in the terrible grasp of death day by day. But what about the condition of their children and relatives? What are they doing? What are they thinking? Some wife might have thought at first that her husband had been arrested and kept in jail, but he would surely be released after a few days. Her husband would be released. With this idea, she was passing her days, relying on her infant son. She was waiting for her husband. But days passed, months passed, and finally many years passed, yet her husband did not return, released. A question constantly arose in her mind, "What crime had her husband committed for which he was kept in jail, separated from his loved ones in this way?" Even after thinking all this, she probably could not give up her faint hope that her husband would surely return one day. But her faint hope was shattered when the news reached that her husband had died in jail. At that moment, this news must have been tragic and cruel to her. She was hurt. Although she was temporarily distraught, according to the normal rules of real life, did not this question constantly arise in her mind later, "Why did her husband die there? What was her husband's crime? Her husband had not committed any crime."

Thinking all this, perhaps some old woman today will spend her life just sighing in a secluded room of the PPV. She will not be able to do more than that. But what will her children do? Will they also sit in a secluded room of the PPV like the old woman and sigh in sorrow for their father? Surely not. When their father was forcibly separated from their mother and them as children and put in jail, they probably did not understand anything. But as they grow older and their intelligence and discretion increase, will not this question arise in their minds, "Where was their father taken and kept, separated from them? Why did their father fall prey to the brutal oppression inside the jail and finally die?" In trying to find the answers to all these questions, they will probably understand that their father's only crime was that he was a Mizo. The Mizos, instead of being subservient, had entered into a life-and-death struggle for full independence. The ruling class had considered their struggle, that is, the liberation struggle, a crime. Finding their father guilty of that crime, they had kept him in jail and brutally pushed him towards a slow death. Thinking all this, will they not carry the national characteristics of their formidable and warlike ancestors and move forward in the coming days? Surely they will move forward. They will be realistic. Thanglura was thinking all this to himself, centered on the death of the Mizo undertrial prisoners inside the jail.

Rangchwanga saw that after he told Thanglura the news of the death of the undertrial prisoners, he remained silent and just kept thinking. So he addressed Thanglura and said,

— Hey, why have you become so quiet?

— No, I am thinking. Thanglura said, breaking his train of thought.

— What are you thinking?

— I am thinking about what the condition of the relatives of the Mizo undertrial prisoners is like after their death. What their successors will do, centered on these incidents, etc.

– They will also think from the same perspective as you and I judge the matter. Thinking that, they will do something. They will not keep themselves confined to their own thoughts like us, confined in jail. They will apply their thoughts in reality. They will move forward to give a real shape to the purpose for which their predecessors were tormented by the oppression of the bearers of vested interests, for which they sacrificed their lives. Saying this, Rangchwanga stopped.

Seeing Rangchwanga and Thanglura talking, a few more young Mizo prisoners came and stood by their side. They could not understand what the two of them were talking about. So one of them, addressing Thanglura and Rangchwanga, said,

— What are you two standing and talking about so merrily?

— No, we are not talking merrily. I was telling him about the death of the Mizo prisoners inside the jail. The conversation is going on based on that. Rangchwanga replied.

The boy was a little embarrassed to hear Rangchwanga's answer. He was thinking that they were probably talking about some funny story of the jail. But no. They were seriously discussing their own matter. It was not right to suddenly say something like this in the middle of their conversation. Anyway, since he has already said it, what can be done? He composed himself and said,

— Are you only talking about the Mizo prisoners who died in jail, have you not said anything else?

— What else is there to say?

— Why, the matter of the Mizo boy who was born?

— No, I haven't said that. Rangchwanga said.

A Mizo boy was born in jail? How did that happen? Thanglura was surprised to hear that a Mizo boy was born in jail. He could not suppress his curiosity to know the matter openly. So he quickly asked the boy,

— A Mizo boy was born in jail?

— Yes, in this jail, Mrs. Rozama has given birth to a son.

— How was that possible?

— What do you mean, how was it possible? It was possible. Thanks to the ruling class, no one was spared, old and young, boys and girls, pregnant women. A few days after we were arrested, Mrs. Rozama was also arrested and kept in this jail. She was pregnant at that time. She continued to spend her days in jail in a pregnant state. Then one day, according to the normal rules, Mrs. Rozama gave birth to a son. The son gradually began to grow up in the confined atmosphere within the four walls of the jail.
The incident was almost like an accident. Mrs. Rozama, as a Mizo undertrial prisoner, gave birth to a son inside the jail. Compared to all those who are imprisoned in jail as seditious or anti-social elements participating in various movements in the eyes of the holy (!) government from the time of Priyadarshini Indira Gandhi's predecessors until now, and are enduring various kinds of torture or persecution, Mrs. Rozama's case is a little different. At first, Mrs. Rozama, seeing the surrounding situation of the jail, was suffering from an unknown apprehension, thinking about her upcoming newborn. Who knows what will happen. She was spending her time inside the jail with thoughts or worries in her mind. Finally, one day, ignoring all her thoughts, the newborn was born. The newborn, after being born, received the faint light and air that penetrated the four walls of the jail.

Rozama was happy to have the newborn. Forgetting the hardships of her daily life in jail, she began to spend her days relying on her son. But that too eventually became monotonous. As the days passed, new problems arose. New thoughts began to tangle in her head. After a long time had passed, Mrs. Rozama began to think that she might have to spend her whole life in jail, but what would happen to this infant child? Would he also have to stay in jail for his whole life? If this boy were outside the jail today, he would have grown up slowly in the environment of his country.
In the way the authorities' rules are being applied here every day, will his normal development take place? Thinking all this, she further thinks, what is her son's fault? He has not even seen the Mizo country. He knows nothing of the Mizo culture or the Mizo customs. He was born in a cell of a jail located far away from the Mizo district. Then why will they keep him confined inside the jail? Or is he the property of the jail authorities because he was born inside the jail? Once these thoughts start, they keep crawling in Mrs. Rozama's head. They make her restless. The tangle of thoughts becomes more and more complex. The thought of her son has now become her own thought. At every moment, she thinks that she may be confined in jail for her whole life, but what about her son's condition? Mrs. Rozama could not ignore the affection and love of a mother for her child. That feeling of affection and love made her worry about her son. Mrs. Rozama may be worrying about her son, sitting inside the jail, or her son's condition may be as unbearable as it is due to various blows, but it is true, all these incidents will be marked as a special incident in the Mizo national life. The future Mizo citizens will not be able to forget them. Mrs. Rozama's little son, too, perhaps, even if he cannot fully realize why he is in this situation, in this environment now, in the coming days, he will surely not be able to forget today. As he grows older, when his judgment and discretion increase, he too will be able to realize why his mother was so cruelly separated from her homeland and kept in jail? Why could he not spend his childhood normally like other Mizo children in the hilly natural environment of the Mizo district? In trying to face all these questions, he will understand the real truth. He will understand how to move forward and build the foundation for the future of the Mizo nation.
Thanglura was listening attentively to the words of Rangchwanga and the boy. Having been in different jails for a long time, he had not received any news of all the incidents that had happened in this jail. Now, hearing all this, he thought that quite a few changes had taken place inside the jail. Some people died. Again, new people gathered. Of course, change is normal. The only unchangeable thing is change itself. As the days go by, how many more changes will happen.

Thanglura, thinking all this to himself, said to Rangchwanga,

— Let's go to your ward now. I don't like to stand in one place and talk like this for a long time.

Rangchwanga responded to Thanglura's words. He started walking towards his own ward. The remaining boys could not decide what to do. They remained standing. Thanglura and Rangchwanga walked side by side. Thanglura said to Rangchwanga,

— While we were in different jails, what kind of changes have taken place in this jail.
Rangchwanga smiled a little at Thanglura's words and said,

— Why won't there be change? There will be change.

— Not only will there be change in our jail. As the days go by, there will be changes in individuals, there will be changes in social life, there will be changes in national life, and those will bring about international changes. And in this wave of change, we and our future citizens will move forward in step.

Saying these words, Rangchwanga and Thanglura entered Rangchwanga's ward.

After being victims of the corruption of the jail authorities and enduring persecution and torture in a routine way for a long time, they finally reached a stage where they could no longer accept everything. So Rangchwanga and the other Mizo prisoners thought that nothing would happen by sitting quietly in jail for a long time like this. With this thought, Rangchwanga, Thanglura, and the others came to a joint decision. They decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike to demand an end to the mistreatment of the prisoners inside the jail and the immediate start of their trial in court. The Mizo prisoners united and, after submitting a memorandum to the authorities, started the hunger strike.

This is the first time in eastern India that undertrial prisoners have united and launched a movement against the authorities in this way. Although the news of this movement of the undertrial Mizo prisoners seemed very important to some classes of the eastern region, the so-called journalists probably considered it untouchable. Perhaps because the news of Vinoba's walk with a stick, Bimala Prasad Chaliha's cold and fever, or the inauguration of a club by the owner of a newspaper gets prominence in their newspapers, the news of the movement of the undertrial Mizo prisoners did not get prominence. Be that as it may, although the newspaper owners ignored it, this incident was not completely suppressed. The government's attention was drawn to the Mizos. A delegation was sent with representatives from different parties of the Assam Legislative Assembly to review the situation in the Mizo hills.

It is difficult to say from what perspective and how the delegation formed with the members of the legislative assembly saw the real situation after going to the Mizo hills. However, from the news that came out after their arrival, they are saying that the influence and authority of the military forces in the Mizo hills must be reduced.
The comments of the delegation that visited the Mizo district with the members of the legislative assembly and the indefinite hunger strike of the undertrial Mizo prisoners in the jail together shook the government circles a little. It was announced on behalf of the Assam cabinet that the trial of the undertrial prisoners detained in jail would start very soon.

The trial of the undertrial Mizo prisoners will start very soon. The Mizo prisoners on hunger strike in the jail, Rangchwanga, Thanglura, and others, all came to know about this decision of the government through the jail authorities. Of course, since the day he entered the jail, Rangchwanga had been hearing that the trial in court would start soon. So this news did not cause any excitement in the minds of the Rangchwangas. Still, since they had started the hunger strike by submitting a memorandum to demand their demands, and in that context, the government had informed them through the jail authorities that the trial would start soon, they took it as a victory of the movement inside the jail. All the undertrial Mizo prisoners broke their hunger strike and expressed the outward feeling that, well, at last they would get some justice. However, a doubt naturally remained in the minds of many undertrial Mizo prisoners, "Will the government's announcement be implemented?"

But no, this time the government's announcement was seen to be a little different. A few days later, groups of Mizo undertrial prisoners were sent from Silchar to Aizawl. There, one by one, the prisoners began to be released from the jail. Gradually, Thanglura and Rangchwanga also came out of the jail.
