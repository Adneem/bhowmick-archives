From: Naresh Bhowmick.
23/1, Kumartuly Street,
Calcutta-5.
Dear Mr. Osmani Saheb,
March 5, 1965.
Many thanks for your letter.
I am glad to know that you had a talk with
Mr. Pannalal Das Gupta at Silchar. Mr. Das Gupta after
release from jail has aligned himself with Krishna Menon
group. Compus is not the only paper he is now publishing,
besides, he is connected with weekly english 'Mainstream'
published from Delhi and financially backed by Krishna
Menon group. As desired in your letter I think no purpose
will be served in meeting Mr. Das Gupta. He is more or
less has become a humanist like our veteran late M.N. Roy
leaving the adjective radical. This is a case almost with
all the revolutionaries of Bengal and Mr. Das Gupta is
not an exception to that.
PSP

So far Socialist movement is concerned,
Baranasi tragedy has added nothing new in it. SSP -
dictated by Dr. Lohia today stands for language and caste.
indirectly dictated by Mr. Asoke Mehta through
Prem Basin, Surendra Mohan, Brijmohan and others stands
for defence of the country. Both these groups have nothing
to do with Socialism. I know Dr. Lohia as well as Mr.
Mehta. So long the socialist movement is allowed to guide
by the leaders of Gandhian School of thoughts, one cannot
expect better performance or any programme ever to be
formulated based on socialist principles. Dr. Lohia today
more interested to Jana Sangha. The reason is very clear.
His parliamentary life after a long fight of a decade has
been established by the backing of Jana Sangha.
In Bengal Kashikanta and others have joined
SSP leaving their long associates in PSP. The reason is also
very clea DIDI group, spokesmen of which are Sunil Das,
Samar Guha not ready to accept the leadership of Kashikanta
who left politics in 1946 and re-entered in 1952. Kashi
kanta elected from Krishnanagar not because of his poli-
tical activities but because of his father late Pandit
Lakhikanta Moitra. There is a proverb in Nadia that Pandit
Lakhikanta Moitra saved Nadia from Pakistan. We have heard
it during Parliamentary bye-election in 1954. Moreover,
Kashi has become a patron of American enterprise. So, how
long he will im accommodate his policy in a party of Dr.
Lchia I don't know.
Kerala election is just over and before
reaching this letter to you the result will be out. Congress
certainly would do better than others. Unwholly alliance
among left parties had given this chance to Congress. In
Calcutta Corporation election, the result will be in favour
of Congress. The left-communist will come second and the
fate of so-called social democrats guided by old bureacrats
would face its natural consequences.
I am not with the social democrats. I could
contest corporation election but knowing the ultimate
result I have rejected this proposal. I hope to come Silchar
by the next Puja. I am writing on economic issues in daily
Basumati and muktakax on political issues in weekly
Darpan. Please convey my good wishes to Mr. Mazumdar, Mr.
Akhtu and others. With best wishes,
Yours,
</pre>
