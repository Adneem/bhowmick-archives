This document contains a fascinating political correspondence from March 1965 between Naresh Bhowmick and Dr. Triguna Sen, who was the Rector of Jadavpur University at the time.

The exchange includes:
- A critical letter from Naresh Bhowmick accusing Dr. Sen of political opportunism regarding the upcoming Calcutta Corporation election and his involvement with the "Progressive Citizens' Bloc" (P.C.B.).
- Dr. Sen's detailed reply, where he refutes the claims and denies involvement in the formation of the P.C.B.
- A final letter from Naresh Bhowmick requesting that the correspondence not be made public to avoid harming the election candidates.

The letters provide a glimpse into the intense local politics of Calcutta during that period.
