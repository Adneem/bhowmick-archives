title: "Pension Application Correspondence for Naresh Bhowmick's Widow (1974-1980)"
date: 2025-12-29
description: "A collection of letters and certificates detailing the bureaucratic struggle for a Freedom Fighters' Pension for the widow of Naresh Chandra Bhowmick."
---

This collection of documents, spanning from 1974 to 1980, chronicles the protracted effort to secure a Freedom Fighters' Pension for Smt. Depali Rani Bhowmick, the widow of Naresh Chandra Bhowmick.

The file includes several key pieces of correspondence:
- An initial letter from the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1974, threatening to close the pension case due to a lack of evidence.
- Personal certificates from Members of Parliament, including Chitta Basu and Dwijendralal Sen Gupta, attesting to Naresh Bhowmick's participation in the Quit India movement and his subsequent imprisonment in Dum Dum Central Jail (1942-43).
- Numerous follow-up letters from MP Chitta Basu to various officials, urging them to take action and highlighting the "extreme distress" of the applicant.
- Responses from the central government indicating that the process was stalled while awaiting a verification report from the Government of Assam.

These documents provide a compelling look at the bureaucratic challenges faced by the families of freedom fighters in seeking the recognition and support they were due.
