This collection of letters from 1980-1981 details the efforts to secure a Freedom Fighters' Pension for Smt. Depali Rani Bhowmick, the widow of Naresh Chandra Bhowmick.

The correspondence, primarily driven by Member of Parliament Chitta Basu, is addressed to Shri Nalini Guha and others. It reveals that the pension approval was pending confirmation from the West Bengal government regarding Naresh Bhowmick's imprisonment in Dum Dum jail in 1942.

A notable inclusion is a letter from India's then-Home Minister, Shri Zail Singh, clarifying the central government's stance and the need for state-level verification. The letters underscore the bureaucratic hurdles involved in the pension process for freedom fighters' families.
