---

This document is the "Open Letter" sent to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on July 27, 1958, by the Socialist Party of West Bengal. It was signed by Chairman Satyananda Bhattacharya and Secretary Naresh Bhowmick.

The letter is a powerful and trenchant critique of the Nehru government's performance twelve years after India's independence. It accuses the ruling party of failing to solve the nation's problems, leading to a "polarisation of poverty" while the privileged few accumulate wealth. It condemns the suppression of protests with police and military force, criticizes the government's foreign policy, and takes offense at remarks Nehru had recently made about Calcutta.

Citing "abysmal tyranny and torture," the letter concludes with a direct and forceful demand for the Prime Minister's immediate resignation.
