This document is a letter dated October 15, 1958, from Naresh Bhowmick to an individual named "Comrade Hector."

The letter recounts a significant event from July 27, 1958, when a deputation from the West Bengal State Socialist Party met with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and West Bengal Chief Minister Dr. B. C. Roy. The author details how they presented an "open letter" to PM Nehru which, upon being read, caused a tense reaction from Dr. Roy as it apparently called for the Prime Minister's resignation.

While PM Nehru disagreed with the call for his resignation, he reportedly assured the deputation that the other issues raised in their memorandum would receive the government's full attention. The author requests that this account be published in a periodical called 'Maral'.
