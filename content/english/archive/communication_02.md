---

This document is a letter dated October 15, 1958, from Naresh Bhowmick to an individual named "Comrade Hector."

The letter recounts a significant event from July 27, 1958, when a deputation from the West Bengal State Socialist Party met with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and West Bengal Chief Minister Dr. B. C. Roy. The author details how they presented an "open letter" to PM Nehru which, upon being read, caused a tense reaction from Dr. Roy as it apparently called for the Prime Minister's resignation.

While PM Nehru disagreed with the call for his resignation, he reportedly assured the deputation that the other issues raised in their memorandum would receive the government's full attention. The author requests that this account be published in a periodical called 'Maral'.

Dear Comrade Hector,
ASSED
15th October, 1958.
Enclosed open letter was handed over to Mr. Nehru, Prime
Minister of India by a deputation consisting of members Com. Satya-
nanda Bhattacharya, Chairman and myself of the West Bengal State
Socialist Party during Mr. Nehru's visit in Calcutta on last 27th
July, 1958.
Earlier, a public meeting was held at the foot of Ochter-
lony Monoment (Maidan) which was addressed by Com, Bhola Chatterji,
Manindra Ch. Paul, Shibaji Singh and Rabin Dutta. After the meeting
a demonstration was taken out and marched at the gate of Governor
house where 144 was in force. The demonstraters were barricaded by a
strong police force. After squatting for an hour a message was sent
by the Prime Minister that he will be pleased to meet a deputation
at Governor House at 7 p.m. Accordingly myself along with Com. Satya
nanda Bhattacharya, Chairman of the party met Prime Minister at 7-30
Pom, and handed over the open letter to him. At the meeting Dr. B
C. Roy, Chief Minister of West Bengal was also present. After formal
introduction I handed over the memorandum to Mr. Nehru. At this
point Dr. Roy, raised some questions which were answered by us, Mr.
Nehru was reading the letter with due attention. During discussions
with Dr. Roy Mr. Nehru suddenly intervenned and said "well Dr. Roy
these are not their demands, they demand my resignationfram from
the stewardship of the country! Dr. Roy got up from his seat and in
a angry xxa voice repeated the same thrice. Dr. Roy also requested
Mr. Nehru to hand over the letter to him but Mr. Nehru kawałyxxxxxx
again read it very loudly. At this point both of them are seemed to
be very much disturbed and left with an impression that if the
contents of the letter were known to them earlier, they should not
accept this deputation on mere demonstration. Then Mr. Nehru got
up and said xerxxmikalyx well I do not entirely agree with you so
far my political role in international politics and my resignation
are concerned but other points raised in your letter will receive
best attention of the Government'. At this no
ended
