---

This postcard, dated June 15, 1956, was sent from the Socialist Party office in Gauhati (Guwahati), Assam, to Comrade Naresh Bhowmick in Silchar.

The letter, signed by "Hareswar" (likely Hareswar Goswami, a notable Socialist leader), welcomes Naresh Bhowmick's presence in Silchar at an "opportune moment." The writer mentions arranging a meeting with Shri Amit Nag to help with the party's weekly publication and confirms that two membership books (one in Hindi, one in Assamese) have been sent separately.

The correspondence points to the active coordination of party activities, including membership drives and organizational tours, across different regions of Assam during that period.
