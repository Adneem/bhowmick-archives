This document is a press statement from the West Bengal branch of the Socialist Party, dated August 12, 1962.

The statement announces that two founding members, Comrade Satyananda Bhattacharya (former Secretary of the West Bengal Socialist Party) and Comrade Naresh Bhowmick (former Secretary of the Calcutta Socialist Party), have expressed their desire to resume work with the party after a ban on their membership had expired. Their letter affirmed their "unflinching faith" in the Socialist Party and indicated that around 50 other inactive members would follow their lead.

The press release includes a welcoming quote from the prominent national leader, Dr. Rammanohar Lohia, who expressed hope that their return would be "helpful in radicalization of the people." The statement was sent to the "Hindusthan Standard" newspaper for publication.
