1st October. It is good of you that you
have decided to join the Party again.
It is high time that you must bring the
students and the youths to take active

Dr.Lohia is now touring the
districts of Uttar Pradesh. Hence he
can't be available at present for consul-
tations. His programme has already fixed
till December.
I think our party is very clear on
question of language. Let me tell you
that a people's movement against English
can only solve the problem. Our Assan
unit also is clear on the language
problem. The P.S.P., Congress and the
communist in Assam have exploited the
language question further her own advantages.
They are all cosmopolitan and are in
favour of returning English. Hence I
