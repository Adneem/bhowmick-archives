description: "A detailed 1961 letter from Naresh Bhowmick explaining his past disciplinary action, his political work in Silchar, and his intention to rejoin the party."
---

This letter, dated October 2, 1961, is a formal request from Naresh Bhowmick to rejoin the Socialist Party.

In this detailed correspondence, Bhowmick provides context for his request:
- He recalls the disciplinary action taken against him in 1958, which led to his departure from the party, and states his desire to return now that the debarment period is over.
- He outlines his activities over the previous two years in Silchar, Assam, where he worked as a socialist without any formal party affiliation.
- He recounts facing both legal and political challenges, including a two-year defamation case and being detained during the 1961 language movement, despite disagreeing with its organizers.
- He proposes the formation of a new party unit in Cachar, suggesting it initially operate independently under the Central Party to steer clear of local "language fanatics."

The letter offers a compelling personal narrative of his political convictions and his strategic plan for contributing to the party's growth in Assam.

From: Naresh Bhowmick,
Ex-Secretary, Socialist Party (Cal)
32, Shyambazar Street, Calcutta-5.
October 2, 1961.
Dear Comrade,81 83133% 67
Perhaps you will remember that
disciplinary action was taken against me by
the Control Commission along with two other
Bengal comrades (Sri Satyananda Bhattacharjee
& Bhola Chatterji) on the ground of our
participation in the meeting of Faction Group
held in Delhi in 1958. As a true socialist
I had no other alternative but to obey the
party decision till expiry of the period and
now, I intend to join the party again.
A
By this time I have shifted my field
of activities from Calcutta to Silchar (Assam)
and since last two years I have been working
there as a socialist without any party affi-
liation. Being afraid of my presence an
interested section of Cachar politicians had
instituted a defamation case against me
(known to you) in September 1959, quoting my
speech delivered at a meeting of silchar
College Students Guardians Association that
I have insinuated them publicly with view to
lower them in the estimation of public and
they have been defamed. The case continued
for long two years in the court and just only
on last 19th June, 1961, the complainant
party unconditionally withdrew the case being
afraid of loosing the same in the court. In
connection with the recent language movement
I had been detained by the police on 18th
May, just before the date of firing, although,
I had sharp difference with the organisers
of the movement (mostly P.S.P & Congress) on
policy matters.

It is interesting to note here that both
Sangram Parishad & Congress jointly acted
and they persuaded the police to arrest me,
although, I was never connected with the
movement instead of their best effort to
persuade me to take active part in the move-
ment. Naturally, they apprehended, if any
movement is at all launched, I may act against
it, so they reported to Police that I am the
Scrediated leader of the movement. As regards
Language issue I stand by your decision and
I will do that in future. It is also grati-
fying to note that a large section of Silchar
students endorse my views and they never
participated in the movement. Only a handful
of conscious students were in the movement.
Now, I have decided to organise a
party unit in Cachar but one thing I like to
write you in this connection, is that, at
present the unit will function as an indepen-
dent one under Central Party with a view to
get rid of language fanatics who are active
and scandelously propogating against the
role of Congress, P.S.P & Communist in Assam
valley. But I assure you that within a very
short period I hope the situation will be
changed I and good relationship between
different communities in Assam is bound to
re-established. I have written to Central
Party for their approval, so, I hope you will
not raise any objection in this respect and
give me an opportunity to work in the party
and to make the proposed unit a very strong
one.
Now, I am in Calcutta and expected
to go back Silchar by the last week of Oct.
Please write to me your views to my above
address and oblige. (studio) KaiA
