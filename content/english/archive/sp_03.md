---

This letter, dated October 2, 1961, is a formal request from Naresh Bhowmick to rejoin the Socialist Party.

In this detailed correspondence, Bhowmick provides context for his request:
- He recalls the disciplinary action taken against him in 1958, which led to his departure from the party, and states his desire to return now that the debarment period is over.
- He outlines his activities over the previous two years in Silchar, Assam, where he worked as a socialist without any formal party affiliation.
- He recounts facing both legal and political challenges, including a two-year defamation case and being detained during the 1961 language movement, despite disagreeing with its organizers.
- He proposes the formation of a new party unit in Cachar, suggesting it initially operate independently under the Central Party to steer clear of local "language fanatics."

The letter offers a compelling personal narrative of his political convictions and his strategic plan for contributing to the party's growth in Assam.
