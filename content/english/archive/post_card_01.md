date: 2025-12-29
description: "A 1956 postcard from the Socialist Party Central Office to Naresh Bhowmick with directives for a membership drive and election preparations."
---

This postcard, dated September 17, 1956, was sent from the Socialist Party's Central Office in Hyderabad to Comrade Naresh Chandra Bhowmick in Calcutta. It serves as a directive for a party-building and membership campaign.

The key instructions on the card include:
- A call to enroll 20 new members, including 5 women, to qualify for active party membership.
- A directive to enroll a significant portion of the electorate as party members to gain clearance for the upcoming General Elections.
- A reminder of the party's ambitious goal to enroll 5 lakh new members within the year.
- A deadline for submitting quotas to be eligible to elect delegates for the National Conference.

A handwritten note on the back from "Sachchidanand" encourages the continuation of a chain letter to mobilize other comrades. This document offers a unique glimpse into the grassroots organizational strategies of the Socialist Party in the 1950s.
