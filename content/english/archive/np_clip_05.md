This newspaper clipping, titled "M. P. Among 28 Arrested," reports on an "Anti-Union Agitation" in Calcutta. The protest was organized by the W.B.L.S.R.C. (West Bengal Linguistic States Reorganisation Committee), likely against the proposed merger of Bengal and Bihar.

The article details the arrest of 28 volunteers, including MP Shri Tushar Chatterjee, for defying a Section 144 order.

Notably, the report mentions that before the demonstration, a send-off meeting was held at Mohammed Ali Park which was **presided over by Shri Naresh Bhowmick**. This places him in a key leadership position during the protests against the state's reorganization. The protest was timed to coincide with the discussion of the States' Reorganisation Commission (S.R.C.) bill in the Lok Sabha, adding to its political significance.
